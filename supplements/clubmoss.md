### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


The *Lycopodium* genus (of the family *Lycopodiaceae*) is a genus of herbs more commonly known as Clubmoss or Toothed Clubmoss, the genus (*Lycopodium*) is synonymous with *Huperzeria* in reference to the main bioactive of clubmoss being [Huperzine-A](/supplements/huperzine-a/) (also known as shuangyiping[[1]](#ref1)); other less common synonyms for this plant include Devil's Ash, Devil's Claw, or Ground Pine.[[2]](#ref2)


The related herb *Lycopodium serratum* appears to be a [traditional chinese medicine](/supplements/traditional-chinese-medicine/) for memory[[3]](#ref3) and the overall genus includes the species of *serratum* or *serrata*, *alpinum*, *annotinum*, *clavatum*, *complanatum* subspecies *chamaecyparissus*, *obscurum*, and *selago*.[[2]](#ref2)



> The genera of *Lycopodium* (also known as *Huperzeria*) is traditionally used for memory improvement and cognition, and several species of this plant appear to have traditional usage


#### 1.2Composition


Plants of the Lycopodium genera tend to contain (species stated if only found in those species, otherwise the compound has been found in various species and is thought to be general):


* [Huperzine-A](/supplements/huperzine-a/) (shuangyiping; commonly seen as the main bioactive)
* The C16N alkaloids lycopodane, lycopodine, alopecurane, fawcettimane, fawcettidane, serratinane and magellanane[[4]](#ref4)[[5]](#ref5)
* Lycoflexine and lycoposerramine[[5]](#ref5)
* Lobscurinol and epilobscurinol, as well as lycobscurines A-C (*Lycopodium obscurum*)[[6]](#ref6)[[7]](#ref7)
* The C16N2 alkaloids ﬂabellidane, phlegmarane and cernuane[[8]](#ref8)[[4]](#ref4)
* Lycopoclavamine A (*Lycopodium clavatum*)[[9]](#ref9)
* Lycoposquarrosamine-A[[9]](#ref9)
* Lycospidine A[[10]](#ref10) as well as Lyconadins D and E (from *Lycopodium complanatum*)[[11]](#ref11)
* Complanadine alkaloids, including Complanadine A,[[12]](#ref12) B,[[13]](#ref13), C.[[14]](#ref14) D,[[14]](#ref14) and E[[11]](#ref11)
* Ferulic Acid (0.443% dry weight)[[15]](#ref15)

> There appears to be a large amount of structurally unique alkaloids in this plant. Although their bioactivity is not completely elucidated right now, they are unique to the genera of *Lycopodium*/*Huperzeria* and there is more than just Huperzine-A

### 2Neurology

#### 2.1Cholinergic Neurotransmission


#### 2.2Neurogenesis


Complanadine structures from *lycopodium complanatum* have been found to induce mRNA for NGF at a concentration of 100μM by 3.9 (complanadine A), 2.3 (complanadine B), 2.4 (complanadine D), and 2.8-fold (complanadine E).[[11]](#ref11) This has been reported previously with complanadines C and D.[[14]](#ref14)



> Complanadine structures (unique to *lycopodium complanatum*) may increase NGF levels, but this occurs at quite a high concentration and may not be practically relevant for supplementation of the plant

### 3Inflammation and Immunology

#### 3.1Interventions


A study using fractions of *Lycopodium clavatum* in a mouse model of acetic-acid induced capillary
permeability increases, it was found that the most active fragment (500mg/kg chloroform extract causing 32.1% inhibition) was less potent than the reference drug of indomethacin at 10mg/kg (44.6% inhibition).[[2]](#ref2) This fraction was mostly (84.5%) lycopodine.[[2]](#ref2)



> Potential anti-inflammatory effects, but seems pretty weak relative to reference drugs and requires quite a high dosage as well

### 4Interactions with Aesthetics

#### 4.1Skin


*Lycopodium clavatum* appears to have traditional usage in Turkey for wound healing properties[[2]](#ref2) and has usage for burn healing as well.[[16]](#ref16)
