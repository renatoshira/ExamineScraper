### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Brassaiopsis glomerulata* (of the family *Araliaceae*) is a deciduous tree found in the north Vietnam regions of Phucyen and Vinhphuc; It appears to have limited medicinal usage for treating rheumatism and back pain in elderly persons.[[1]](#ref1)

* Stigmasterol, 6β-hydroxystimasta-4-en-3-one, 7β-hydroxy-4,22-stigmastadien-3-one[[2]](#ref2)
* N-*benzoyl*-L-phenylalaninyl-N-benzoyl-L-phenylalaninate, N-*acetyl*-L-phenylalaninyl-N-benzoyl-L-phenylalaninate, and N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester
* Spinasterone and spinasterol
* Oleanolic acid
* (−)-dihydroactinidiolide
* (−)-dehydrololiolide

> Not fully elucidated, but appears to have a general assortment of triterpenoids that may be unique to this plant

### 2Pharmacology

#### 2.1Enzymatic Interactions


*In vitro* at 20mcg/mL, a hexane-soluble extract appears to reduce aromatase activity t0 6.9-7.2% of the activity of untreated control cells, which appeared to also apply to the ethyl acetate fraction (37-59.3% of control).[[2]](#ref2) When looking at molecules which could underlie this aromatase inhibition, it was found that *(−)-dehydrololiolide* (21.8% of control activity at 50μM in a cell culture) was able to potently inhibit aromatase to a degree that was not statistically different than letrozole (10nM); additionally, *N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester* (33.3% of control activity) and *6β-Hydroxystigmasta-4-en-3-one* was weaker in inhibiting aromatase yet still active.[[2]](#ref2) The inhibition was thought to be indirect, as all compounds were fairly inactive in enzyme only assays (showing activity in cellular assays).[[2]](#ref2)


Although linoleic acid was more effective than the reference drug aminoglutethimide in an enzyme assay, it was inactive in a cell assay;[[2]](#ref2) this may be due to false positives associated with fatty acids in cell-free cultures.[[3]](#ref3)

### 3Interactions with Hormones

#### 3.1Testosterone


It has been noted that active components of *Brassaiopsis glomerulata* can inhibit the aromatase enzyme *in vitro*,[[2]](#ref2) but no evidence currently exists to support an increase in testosterone or decrease in estrogen in a living system.
