*Syzygium aromaticum* (of the family ) is a spice commonly referred to as Cloves, and appears to have some traditional usage as an [aphrodisiac](/supplements/aphrodisiac/) as well as for the medicinal purposes of dental disorders, respiratory disorders, headache and sore throat.[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)

### 2Neurology

#### 2.1Aphrodisia


A 50% hydroalcoholic extract of *syzygium aromaticum* at 500mg/kg acutely is able to increase mounting of male mice with a potency nonsignificantly lesser than nutmeg (*Myristica fragrans*) and significantly less than 5mg/kg Viagra.[[3]](#ref3) Later, oral intake of 100-500mg/kg of a 50% hydroalcoholic extract of *syzygium aromaticum* for seven days showed dose-dependent libido enhancement with a potency still lesser than 5mg/kg Viagra.[[4]](#ref4)



> Appears to have libido enhancing properties, although they are significantly less than that of Viagra and nonsignificantly less than the other libido enhancer tested (Nutmeg)

### 3Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 3.1Testicles (and male fertility)


Oral ingestion of 15mg/kg *Syzygium aromaticum* in male mice for 35 days is associated with increased testicular Δ5 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD enzyme activity (thought to underlie the observed increases in testosterone).[[2]](#ref2)


30-60mg/kg dietary *Syzygium aromaticum* in male mice appears to induce testicular toxicity as assessed by serum testosterone and histological examination of the semineferous tubules.[[2]](#ref2)


The essential oil of clove possesses spermicidal activity *in vitro* when incubated alongside the sperm[[5]](#ref5) which may be rlated to the Eugenol content as this molecule has been known to possess anti-fertility actions.[[6]](#ref6)

### 4Interactions with Hormones

#### 4.1Testosterone


Oral ingestion of an extract from the flower buds of *Syzygium aromaticum* at 15, 30, or 60mg/kg for 35 days in otherwise healthy male mice noted that the lowest dose of 15mg/kg increased serum testosterone 26% while the two higher doses were associated with reductions of testosterone (38-39%) secondary to testicular damage.[[2]](#ref2)
