### 1Structure and Sources

L-Threonate is a deriviative of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (which in and of itself is a derivative of Ascorbic Acid, otherwise known as [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c/)).

### 2Effects on Hair Loss

L-threonate is able to repress the expression of a gene known as dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) which is upregulated by Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male pattern baldness when co-cultured.[[1]](#ref1) It seems to work similarily to L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate via alkaline phosphatase activity and releasing ascorbic acid into the cell.[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3)

### 3Effects on Bone Metabolism

Independent of its use as a conjugate to Calcium as Calcium-L-Threonate (to be discussed), L-Threonate has been investigated for its usage in bone health. It has been implicated as working synergistically with calcium in the production of collagen and mineralized nodules.[[4]](#ref4)[[5]](#ref5) and augments the uptake of ascorbic acid into fibroblasts.[[6]](#ref6) By itself, L-threonate can also act on osteoclasts in an anti-osteoporotic manner.[[7]](#ref7)

### 4Use as a mineral chelation

Minerals bound to L-threonate tend to have rapid intestinal uptake and report minimal gastrointestinal side effects. Minerals such as Iron[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9), Calcium[[5]](#ref5), and Magnesium[[10]](#ref10)[[11]](#ref11) have been tested with L-Threonate chelations.[[12]](#ref12)

### 5Safety and Toxicity

The safety and toxicity of L-threonate has not been investigated.
