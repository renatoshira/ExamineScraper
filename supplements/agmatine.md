Sources

Agmatine is a molecule (specifically, a biogenic amine,[1]) which is a decarboxylated form of L-Arginine and has the molecular name of 4-(aminobutyl)guanidine;[2] prior to its naming as Agmatine, it was referred to as 'Clonidine-displacing substance' as it was discovered to displace bound Clonidine from receptors.[3]


Agmatine is a small biogenic amine that can serve as a signalling molecule in the human body; it is a decarboxylated form of the amino acid L-arginine


Agmatine is a bacterial byproduct (due to expression of the enzyme that makes agmatine from arginine being expressed in bacteria) and as such it is found in fermented foods including:[4]

Wine at up to 6.5ppm in white and 22ppm in red[5][6]Beer at 0.5–42ppm[7][8][9]Sake at 114ppm[10]Coffee (instant) at 0.4–5.3ppm[11]Terrestrial meat products (3.1ppm normally, increased to 27ppm after cooking and up to 42ppm if fermented)[12][13][14][15]Fish (highly variable at undetectable up to 401ppm)[16][17][18]Food products that have failed to have a detectable agmatine concentration include green and roasted coffee,[19] flour,[20] and both soy sauce and cabbage juice.[21]


Agmatine is found in a variety of food products alongside other polyamines, but the concentrations found in food is significantly lower than standard supplemental dosages and likely not biologically relevant


1.2

Structure and Properties

Agmatine is a biogenic amine with one or two positive charges, which prevents it from passively transporting across membranes (requiring transporters).[22] The molecule is a strong base (alkaline) normally,[23] is diprotonated form dominates at a pH of 7.2 (near physiological concentrations) and is the most stable (1325kJ/mol) followed by the monoprotonated (1070kJ/mol) and neutral (705kJ/mol)[24] with a pKa of 8.93.[25]

Due to its lipophilicity and high level of hydrogen bonds, it is hypothesized to be poorly absorbed.[25]

1.3

Biosythesis

The enzyme expression of Arginine Decarboxylase (ADC) in human tissues[26] appears to differ from bodily areas where Agmatine naturally accumulates,[27][28] with this discord through to be due to most bodily Agmatine not being due to biosynthesis via ADC.[2]

In general, the mRNA of the ADC enzyme is relatively highly expressed in the liver and kidneys with detectable levels in skeletal muscle, the small intestine,[29][30][31][32] and brain (higher in hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and hippocampus; comparatively lower in the striatum and cerebral cortex with the PVN being noted.[33] Mostly on neurons, with the highest immunohistology appearing on neocortical and hippocampal interneurons[33]); some in immune cells such as macrophages[34] and lymphocytes.[35]

When looking at where Agmatine accumulates in the body, rat studies suggest that the highest levels appear to be in the stomach, small intestine and adrenal gland[27][28] with some presence in smooth muscle and endothelial cells[36] with comparatively lower concentrations detected in heart, spleen, aortic and brain tissue.[27][28] When looking at areas of the brain that are comparatively higher in Agmatine, the rat hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei appear to have high concentrations[37] usually in terminals of neurons forming excitatory synapses with pyramidal neurons.[38] Comparatively concentrated areas in the lower brainstem (visceral relay nuclei the nucleus tractus solitarii and pontine parabrachial complex, and periventricular areas including the laterodorsal nucleus, locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe[39]), midbrain (ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray[39]), and forebrain (preoptic area, amygdala, septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, midline thalamus, and the hypothalamus[39]) have been reported. A few sources suggested that not only neurons have Agmatine, and that astrocytes[40] and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla[41] have expressed Agmatine concentrations.

Four other sources of Agmatine are currently known including gut microflora and dietary sources.[42] Enterohepatic circulation may also account for preserving Agmatine concentrations in the body.[42][2]

1.4

Metabolism

Although L-Arginine directly converts into nitric oxide (via conversion into L-citrulline and giving off NO as a byproduct after being subject to the nitric oxide synthase enzyme), agmatine is unable to be a substrate for nitric oxide.[43][44][45][46] Although agmatine may influence nitric oxide metabolism, it is not due to being converted into nitric oxide.


Agmatine is not a metabolic precursor of nitric oxide


One possible pathway of metabolism of agmatine is being subject to the diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme,[3] which also handles metabolism of histamine and is known as histaminase,[47][48] and when agmatine is subject to DAO, the product is 4-guanidinobutyrate.[49]

This pathway has been suggest to account for up to 50% of agmatine metabolism (in rat hepatocytes),[49] and inhibiting this enzyme approximately doubles plasma agmatine in rats (0.7 to 1.3µM in this study).[47] DAO is expressed in high levels in kidney tissue, gastrointestinal and epithelial tissue, and smooth muscle cells of the endothelium yet does not appear to be present in skeletal or cardiac muscle, liver, brain, or adrenals.[47]


Agmatine can convert to 4-guanidinobutyrate via the DAO enzyme, which is possibly the main catabolite of agmatine. This enzyme appears to be expressed in high levels in mucus membranes, kidneys, and endothelium


Agmatine is able to convert into the polyamine putrescine, and can do this directly via the agmatinase enzyme, which gives off urea as a byproduct[50][43] or indirectly via conversion into carbamoyl putrescine (agmatine deiminase enzyme), which gives off ammonia as a byproduct, and is then converted into putrescine itself (carbamoyl phosphate as byproduct) via the putrescine transcarbomylase enzyme.[51] Regardless of the pathway, around 10% of agmatine appears to be metabolized into polyamines.[49]

Agmatine has been noted to increase activity of the protein known as antizyme,[52] which can suppress intracellular accumulation of polyamines[52] and polyamine synthesis from ornithine via inhibition of L-ornithine decarboxylase;[53] this enzyme is induced by polyamines themselves, and agmatine is the only known molecule to induce this enzyme that is not a polyamine.[54]


Agmatine is an intermediate in polyamine synthesis between arginine and the polyamine known as putrescine, and the conversion of agmatine into putrescine can take one of two pathways to produce either urea or ammonia. Despite this, however, agmatine may be inhibitory on polyamine bioactivity by reducing the amount of polyamines in cells


One in vitro study has also noted that approximately 1-3% of agmatine incubated in rat hepatocytes was converted into GABA,[49] which is much less than polyamines (10%) and guanidinobutyraldehyde (50%); 30% of agmatine was not metabolized in this study.


Likely not practically relevant


If the latter pathway is chosen and carbamoyl phosphate is produced, it can be metabolized into carbamate via the carbamate kinase enzyme, which simultaneously converts ADP into ATP. This pathway, known as the deiminase pathway, is a way for bacteria to produce ATP from arginine and agmatine.[55][56][57]

The above mechanism is common to transcarbomylase enzymes (that produce carbamoyl phosphate), as both ornithine transcarbomylase[58][59] and oxamate transcarbamylase[60][61] have been linked to bacterial ATP production through carbamate production.


In bacteria at least (human relevance not known and probably doubtful), agmatine can be used to create ATP


1.5

Regulation

Serum concentrations of agmatine have been detected in the ranges of 6.8+/-0.6ng/mL[62] and 6.8-16.9ng/mL[63] in rats, but appear to be significantly higher in humans such as 47ng/mL,[64] 33.8+/-16.6ng/mL,[65] or 79.42-82.44ng/mL.[66]

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of agmatine in rats are in the range of 6.1-23.5ng/mL,[63] while those in humans range from 24.3-54.0ng/mL.[65] The latter study noted a possible correlation between CSF and serum agmatine concentrations.[65]

Neural concentrations in rats have been noted to be in the range of 15.3+/-2.4ng/g,[62] while bovine brain has higher concentrations (1.5-3.0nmol/g or 0.2-0.4µg/g).[67] The concentrations in the bovine brain are correlated with those of catecholamines, as 0.2-0.4µg/g of agmatine in cow brain is similar to 0.5µg/g concentrations seen for both noradrenaline and dopamine.[67]


Agmatine has a regulated serum concentration and it appears to be in the range of 50ng/mL or higher for humans than it is for rats. Its concentrations are similar to those seen with catecholamines


Plasma agmatine levels (independent of supplementation) have been noted to be significantly reduced in metabolic syndrome (by 3.7%)[66] and significantly elevated in both schizophrenia[68] and depression.[69]


Agmatine appears to be reduced in metabolic syndrome (by a small amount) and elevated in some neurological disorders such as depression and schizophrenia

Pharmacology

2.1

Transportation in Serum

Agmatine has been found to be absorbed following oral ingestion[70] and oral ingestion appears to influence cognition[71] (suggesting that it can reach the brain).

When looking at the distrubution, low doses (9nmol in rats) is able to increase bodily concentrations of agmatine in all tested organs (stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, lungs, brain, colon, kidneys, adrenals, heart, and skeletal muscle) with 64+/-7% being detected in the liver after 3 hours.[70]


Appears to be absorbed following oral ingestion and readily distributed to tissues; it appears to reach the brain following oral ingestion


In systemic circulation, agmatine appears to have a half-life of less than 10 minutes[72][73] although in the brain it appears to have a half-life exceeding 12 hours.[72]


There appears to be a fairly short half-life in systemic circulation (not the brain), while the half-life in the brain itself appears to be much longer


2.2

Cellular Uptake

Agmatine cannot passively cross plasma membranes due to being protonated at physiological pH, and thus requires transporters. It does appear to be readily taken up by rat hepatocytes (rate of 0.37+/-0.04nmol/h/mg protein).[49] Uptake into cells appears to have some overlap with putrescine transportation, as high concentrations of putrescine can inhibit agmatine uptake[70][74] and vice versa.[49] Transportation is energy dependent.[74]

The Extraneuronal Monoamine Transporter (EMT) and Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2) transporters can accept agmatine with similar capacities, with the OCT1 transporter being significantly (9-fold) less active.[75] These receptors are saturatable at 1-2mM (Km) with a Vmax of 8-16nmol/min/mg protein (11.5+/-1.1 for OCT2 and 15.9+/-3.5 for EMT).[75]


Agmatine appears to be taken up by transporters into cells and tissue, and the transporters used have overlap with putrescine transporters. EMT and OCT2 are suspected of being the transporters


2.3

Neurological Distribution

When looking at specific brain regions, agmatine in basal conditions (without supplementation) has been detected in the brains of rats in the cortex (14.9-16.6ng/g), hypothalamus (19.5-23.9ng/g), medulla (22.2-25.9ng/g), cerebellum (20.6-37.0ng/g), and hippocampus (23.6-33.1ng/g).[62] An overall immunohistological approach notes that most agmatine concentration is present in the cerebral cortex and subiculum (inferior portion of the hippocampus), but can be detected in other brain regions when an axon transport inhibitor is used (such as the forebrain and brainstem); there is no detectable agmatine containined neurons in the cerebellum nor spinal cord.[39]

Agmatine concentrations in the brain are correlated with imidazoline receptor concentrations[64] and with concentrations of the enzyme that creates agmatine (arginine decarboxylase);[76][67] the enzyme that degrades agmatine (agmatinase) appears to also be well expressed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus but not in the cortex.[50]


Agmatine is expressed in various brain regions, and is particularly rich in the inferior portion of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex


Agmatine is known to cross the blood brain barrier where 10, 50, and 300mg/kg injections of agmatine into mice noted that the highest dose was able to increase neural agmatine to approximately 800ng/g (700% higher than baseline) and in monkeys injected with 25-200mg/kg agmatine it was found that the rise in cerebral agmatine (11.3μM or 1,469ng/mL) was approximately 16% that of the plasma rise in agmatine (70.2μM or 9,126ng/mL).[63] There appears to be a rather long elimination phase from the brain (between 24-72 hours).[77]

In both mice and monkeys, L-arginine injections failed to increase brain agmatine.[63]


Agmatine can increase brain agmatine concentrations at high doses, and can cross the blood brain barrier. Plasma agmatine rises to a larger degree than does neural agmatine concentrations, and administering L-arginine does not increase agmatine concentrations

Neurology

3.1

Imidazoline Neurotransmission

Agmatine is a ligand for imidazoline receptors with most affinity towards the I1 receptor subset followed by I2b.[91] Its affinity is greater enough to displace idazoxan from the receptor, similar to how it can displace clonidine from the α2A receptor[92] and has been calculated (EC50 values) at 0.7µM and 1µM for I1 and I2 receptors, respectively.[67]


Agmatine is an Imidazoline receptor agonist (activator) with fairly high affinity


Downstream of the imidazoline receptor lays an increase in β-endorphin secretion.[93]


Activation of imidazoline receptors underlies an increase in endorphins (and the effects of that, likely analgesia and blood glucose reductions)


3.2

Adrenergic Neurotransmission

Agmatine is known to interact with the alpha-2 (α2) subsets of the adrenergic receptors, and has affinity for all four subsets (variable Ki between 0.8–164μM[94][86][67][95][94] and an EC50 of 4µM has been noted to be lower than noradrenaline at 0.8µM, the main ligand of adrenergic receptors,[67]) while having poor or no significant affinity for the alpha-1 (α1) subset nor β-adrenergic receptors.[86][67] In regards to its affinity for the α2A receptors, it can displace clonidine from the binding site.[91][67]

One study has noted that 10µM agmatine has shifted the concentration-response curve to the left (indicative of enhancing the signalling of noradrenaline and the agonist moxonidine with IC50 values of 7.76 and 6.86), while 100-1,000µM agmatine had the opposing effect and hindered signalling; the authors concluded that at low doses agmatine is a positive allosteric modulator of α2A signalling while at higher concentrations it inhibits signalling competitively.[86]


Agmatine has high affinity for the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, with little to no affinity for the alpha-1 subsets nor the entire class of beta-adrenergic receptors. It appears to be a positive allosteric modulatory at low concentrations (enhancing the signals of other ligands without inherently activating the receptor), while at higher concentrations it can act as a competitive inhibitor


Numerous studies in vitro have failed to find a per se agonistic property of agmatine on these receptors (in line with the role of an allosteric modulator, which does not inhernetly act on the signalling of a receptor),[96][95] while those in living models have noted that some effects of agmatine can be abolished with α2A receptor inhibitors (yohimbine and rauwolscine most commonly).[97][98]


Agmatine definitely appears to signal through α2A receptors in living models, possibly due to the allosteric modification mentioned earlier. This is not always seen in vitro, possibly due to not introducing other ligands into the medium (as agmatine would enhance the signalling of other ligands, it presumes another ligand is present)


Agmatine has its concentrations correlated with catecholamines in the bovine brain (0.2-0.4µg/g for agmatine, 0.5µg/g for dopamine and noradrenaline)[67] and is known to influence a subset of catecholamine receptors (the α2 adrenergic receptors) while not significantly influencing the others (α1 adrenergic, β-adrenergic, and dopamine D2 receptors).[67]

Agmatine is thought to interact with monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes as imidazoline ligands usually have this property since MAO enzymes are structurally similar to imidazoline receptors.[99][100] Agmatine has been found to be a ligand for MAOA near the flavin site (somewhat weak in preventing kynuramine from being oxidized, IC50 at 1,000µM[24]) and elsewhere has been noted to have an IC50 value of 168µM but not be significantly active in vivo.[100]


Agmatine has its concentrations correlated with catecholamine levels, and is known to interact with the MAO enzymes as well although weakly (MAO inhibition is likely not a practical concern with supplemental agmatine due to the high concentration needed)


It shows positive regulation such as a concentration-dependent release of adrenaline and noradrenaline from adrenal chromaffin cells with an EC50 of 5µM[67] (these cells express imidazoline but not α2A receptors,[101] so this was thought to be indicative of acting on imidazoline receptors which induce catecholamine synthesis[102]) and elsewhere has been noted to increase the actions of noradrenaline secondary to α2A receptors (in endothelial cells).[103] This potentiation is cocaine-sensitive (prevented by cocaine, an inhibitor of the noradrenaline transporter) yet agmatine does not modify the noradrenaline transporter per se.[103]

However, activation of the α2A receptors in endothelial cells has been shown to suppress synthesis of catecholamines,[103] while imidazoline receptor activation may also suppress catecholamines.[104]


Agmatine appears to have a regulatory role for catecholamines, and has been implicated in both inducing and suppressing their release. Practical implications of supplemental agmatine are not currently known


3.3

Glutamatergic Neurotransmission

Agmatine has affinity for the NMDA receptors (IC50 value in the 100-300μM range[105]) as the guanidine group of agmatine interacts with the NMDA channel pore,[106] and has been noted to bind to both the MK-801 binding site[107] and the polyamine binding site (Ki of 15μM)[88] but not the glutamate nor glycine binding sites.[105] As agmatine does not have the ability to activate the receptor up to 100μM[106] and can displace MK-801, which is a noncompetitive antagonist and channel blocker of the NMDA receptor.[108] Though there is evidence for inhibition of the receptor and protection from neurotoxic stressors that signal via the NMDA receptor[109][109][109][71] but those that act on the same signalling pathway but circumvent the receptor (calcimycin and staurosporin) are unaffected.[109]

Kainate and AMPA receptors are mostly unaffected, with 3,000μM concentration only inhibiting 15-20% of activity,[106] and four heterodimers (ε1ζ1 through ε4ζ1) are equally inhibited with agmatine.[105]
