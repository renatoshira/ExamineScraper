### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


Amaranth is the common name used to refer to plants in the *amaranthus* genus (of the *Amaranthaceae* family).


Species used in supplementation include *amaranthus tricolor*,[[1]](#ref1) *amaranthus paniculatus*, *amaranthus caudatus*, and *amaranthus cruentus*.[[2]](#ref2) 


While the grain of these plants is used nutritively, the leaves are also sometimes used as dietary supplements.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 1.2Composition


Amaranth tends to contain:


* Betacyanins, the pigments that gives amaranth a red colouration.[[2]](#ref2) The overall levels varying depending on growing conditions such as soil quality[[2]](#ref2) and light levels.[[3]](#ref3) Concentrations have been noted to be in the range of 7-30mg/100g fresh weight of sprouts[[2]](#ref2)

### 2Cardiovascular Health

#### 2.1Blood Flow


In otherwise healthy subjects, supplementation of 2g amaranth grain was able to increase both salivary and plasma levels of [nitrate](/supplements/nitrate/) and nitrite when compared to placebo.[[4]](#ref4)

### 3Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

#### 3.1Blood Glucose


One study using the leaves of *amaranthus tricolor* (9 grams over three months) in postmenopausal women found that supplementation was associated with a 10.4% reduction in fasting glucose compared to control.[[1]](#ref1) This change was attributed to the antioxidant properties of the leaves, as benefit was also found in this study with [Moringa oleifera](/supplements/moringa-oleifera/) which acts via its antioxidant content.[[1]](#ref1)

### 4Inflammation and Immunology

#### 4.1Macrophages


When tested in RAW 264.7 macrophages, amaranth seeds and sprouts from *amaranthus cruentus* (10 μg/mL) appeared to exert an antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-kB translocation and limiting the amount of IL-6 secreted after stimulation from LPS.[[2]](#ref2)

### 5Interactions with Oxidation

#### 5.1General


In postmenopausal women given supplemental amaranth (9 grams of the leaf powder) over the course of three months, supplementation appeared to have a small benefit to the amount of the antioxidant enzyme known as *superoxide dismutase* (SOD; increase of 10.8%) and concomitant decrease in lipid peroxidation (9.6% assessed by MDA).[[1]](#ref1)
