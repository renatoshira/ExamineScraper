* [Caffeine](/supplements/caffeine/), sometimes at 1% total weight of coffee beans.[[2]](#ref2)
* [Chlorogenic Acid](/supplements/chlorogenic-acid/), up to 7% total weight of coffee beans[[2]](#ref2) but found to a higher level in [Green coffee extract](/supplements/green-coffee-extract/)
* Chlorogenic Lactone
* Caffeic Acid
* Nicotinic Acid
* N-methylpyridinium compounds[[3]](#ref3)
* [Cholinergic](/supplements/cholinergic/) compounds
* 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF)
* Trigonelline, up to 1% of coffee beans by weight.[[2]](#ref2)
* Pyrogallol[[4]](#ref4)
* Catechol[[4]](#ref4)
* Melanodin structures, or small phenolics bound to sugars[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6)

Beans also tend to have: 13% oil content by weight, 13% protein content by weight, 15% hemicellulose and 18% holocellulose, 2% lignan, 4% ash, 3% pectin, 7% sucrose and 1% reducing sugars.[[2]](#ref2)


Doses of all compounds vary on bean quality, length to initiation of processing, type of processing and preparation method, and length of time processed.
