### 1Structure and Sources

Squalene is a Triterpenoid compound[[1]](#ref1) that is synthesized *in vivo* by human livers as a precursor to cholesterol synthesis. Like many terpene compounds, squalene is fat-soluble.[[2]](#ref2) Like cholesterol, it is secreted through the skin[[3]](#ref3) and is important in the Skin Surface Lipid (SSL) film that protects the body from the external environment.[[4]](#ref4)


It is widespread in nature, but most commonly found in [Olive Oil](/supplements/olive-oil/), Shark Oil, Wheat Germ, and Rice Bran.[[2]](#ref2) The squalene content of olive oil is variable between 3.6-9.6mg per gram of extra virgin olive oil.[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6) The squalene content appears to be unaffected by heat processing.[[7]](#ref7)


Shark *liver* oil appears to be 40% Squalene by weight.[[8]](#ref8)[[2]](#ref2) The standard intake of squalene is 30mg per day with the Standard North American diet and up to 200-400mg a day in those who consume liberal amounts of olive oil or practitioners of the Mediterranean diet.[[2]](#ref2)

### 2Metabolism and Pharmacology

Squalene is a 6-isoprenoid unit containing triterpenoid. It is produced *in vivo* by (1) the conversion of Acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA, the (2) reduction of HMG-CoA into mevalonate via HMG-CoA reductase, the (3) phosphrylation and decarboxylation of mevalonate to form delta 3-isopentenyl diphosphate, which is the donor molecule for polyprenyl compounds. D3IDP then (4) adds phenyl groups to form farnesyl diphosphate, and then (5) two farnesyl diphosphate molecules undergo a reactive coupling to form a single squalene molecule.[[9]](#ref9) Due to squalene synthesis being downstream of HMG-CoA, statins (HMG-CoA) can inhibit *in vivo* squalene production.[[10]](#ref10)


After synthesis (in the skin and liver), it is either secreted by sebaceous glands in the skin[[11]](#ref11) or bound to LDL and vLDL for transport.[[2]](#ref2)


If ingested, approximately 20% of squalene is cyclized into sterols and ejected back into the gut without being effectively taken up into systemic circulation.[[12]](#ref12)[[13]](#ref13) Despite this, approximately 60-85% of orally ingested squalene is distributed to body tissues.[[14]](#ref14)[[15]](#ref15)

### 3Squalene and Cancer risk

Squalane initially interested cancer researchers with the observed correlation between a high amount of squalene in shark fatty tissues and the absence of cancer in this species[[8]](#ref8)[[2]](#ref2) as well as possibly playing a significant role in lower cancer rates found with the Mediterranean Diet.[[16]](#ref16)[[17]](#ref17)


It has been theorized that the mechanism of action by which squalene exerts anti-carcinogenic effects is through decreasing farnesyl pyrophosphate levels in cells, of which prenylation of FPP is required for oncogene activation.[[5]](#ref5) A mechanism which has been suggested to reduce cancer risk without drastically altering the normal biochemicular pathway.[[2]](#ref2)[[5]](#ref5)


The mechanism by which Squalene has been hypothesized to act is via increasing squalene levels in the body, sending inhibition via negative feedback to the HMG-CoA enzyme, and thus creating less synthesis of FPP.[[5]](#ref5)[[18]](#ref18) This mechanism would mean protection for for breast, pancreatic, colon carcinomas, and similar tumors associated with oncogene mutations.


Beyond the main mechanisms, Squalene can also act as a free radical scavenger[[18]](#ref18) and seems to enhance the anti-carcinogenic effect of co-ingested drug treatments.[[19]](#ref19)[[20]](#ref20) and shows synergism against cancer with oleic acid, another constituent of olive oil.[[21]](#ref21)


Squalene, via scavenging toxic metabolites, also show some promise in alleviating chemotherapy induced side-effects; although no applied trials have been conducted.[[22]](#ref22)[[23]](#ref23)

### 4Non-cancer uses of Squalene

Squalene can potentially protect the skin against oxidation and ultraviolet radiation. Its importance is illustrated by having 12% of overall bodily squalene content secreted from the skin[[5]](#ref5), and it exhibiting antiradioactive and antioxidative properties[[24]](#ref24) as well as shark oil being used with efficacy in treating some select skin conditions.[[25]](#ref25)


Squalene can also be seen as anti-aging due to its protection of the skin (one symptom of aging) as well as enhancing the efficacy of the mitochondria.[[26]](#ref26) And despite squalene inducing an oxygenating effect in cells (incorporating more oxygen for cellular reactions) it exerts an overall anti-oxidative effect.[[2]](#ref2)[[27]](#ref27)

### 5Squalene and Medicinal sciences

Squalene is commonly used as an adjuvant (a substance employed to increase or to modulate the immune response against an antigen[[28]](#ref28)) as a squalene-in-water solution stabilized with polysorbate 80; it has been proven to be effective as an adjuvant with good chemicular stability.[[29]](#ref29)[[30]](#ref30)[[31]](#ref31)

### 6Safety profile

Although no acute toxicity has been reported with Squalene, there is no long term evidence for squalene consumption above the doses commonly found in foods.[[2]](#ref2)[[32]](#ref32)
