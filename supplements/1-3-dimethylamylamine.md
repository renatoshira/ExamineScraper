### 1Structure and Function

DMAA is a straight chain, 7 carbon, aliphitic amine with a structural similarity to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA.[[3]](#ref3) It was first introduced as a nasal decongestant[[4]](#ref4) but more recently is used as a neurological stimulant and party pill.


DMAA also shares structural similarity to Propylhexedrine, a stimulant drug and nasodilator which may have fat-burning effects *in vivo*. 


Due to its structural similarities, its mechanism of action may be as an adrenaline mimetic; inducing the same effects as adrenaline and the preceding compounds *in vivo*. However, direct studies on the pharmacokinetics of DMAA metabolism do not exist.

### 2Safety and Legality

#### 2.1Acute safety


Although seemingly well tolerated in pre-workout supplemental form, DMAA has been linked to a cerebral haemorrhage in a case study with party pill usage.[[5]](#ref5)Â 


No long-term toxicity studies are in existence, although acute LD50 of DMAA has been established at 39mg/kg bodyweight intravenous injection and 185mg/kg bodyweight intraperitoneal injection.[[6]](#ref6) Theoretically well below what can be achieved via oral ingestion.


#### 2.2Legality


DMAA, touted as being a component of geraniums, has been failed to be detected in geranium oil in one independent lab analysis.[[7]](#ref7)


#### 2.3Drug Testing in Competitions


DMAA causes a false positive for amphetamines in drug-tested sports competitions and should not be used by athletes being moderated by a drugs ethics association.[[3]](#ref3)

### 3Effect on Blood Pressure

DMAA alone and in combination with [Caffeine](/supplements/caffeine/) has been shown in a double blind trial to significantly increase blood pressure, but had not effect on heart rate.[[8]](#ref8)
