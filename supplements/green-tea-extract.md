Sources and Composition

1.1

Origin and Composition

About 30% of the leaves by weight are either favonols or flavanols, the latter of which is comprised mostly of compounds called catechins. These catechins are then broken down into four main classifications of: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epi-gallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epicatechin (EC). Although all catechins share similar properties, EGCG appears to be most potent in regards to many of them. These four catechins are the main catechins, although some other isomers or conjugates may be present (with either catechin or epicatechin as a backbone, and varying levels of gallic acids).

Common sources of green tea catechins (primarily the four stated) include:

Tea from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis, used to prepare White, Green, Oolong, and Black teas.Chungtaejeon Tea (Korean fermented tea)[6] which has lesser amounts of catechins but a higher anti-oxidant potential1.2

Structure

There are five 'catechins' in Green Tea. The parent compound is found in two isomers (catechin is the trans isomer, and epicatechin the cis isomer), and epicatechin also exists with a hydroxylation as epigallocatechin. Both epicatechin and epigallocatechin can become acylated with Gallic Acid to form gallates. For the purpose of this article, all five will be referred to as 'Green Tea Catechins'.

The two molecules that have gallic acid moeties hanging off the bottom right hand side of the above picture (EGCG and ECG) share properties that are not seen with the other two (EGC, EC, and C); this is because the gallic acid moiety itself may contribute to structure-function.

1.3

Formulations and Variants

A combination of green tea catechins and L-theanine called LGNC-07 has been investigated for its ability to improve memory. In one study on patients suffering from non-clinical memory decline (average age 58) it shows some efficacy, mostly in increasing recognition speed, word reading, and selective attention.[7] LGNC-07 is a 6:1 ratio of green tea catechins to theanine, with 360mg catechins and 60mg theanine per 430mg capsule.[7]

The mechanism of action of this combination, as seen in animal models, may be through acetylcholinesterase inhibition.[8] The combination was more potent at alleviating toxin-induced memory loss than either compound in isolation.

Molecular Targets

2.1

Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)

COMT is an enzyme that is able to methylate and (usually) inactivate a few compounds, including green tea catechins and adrenaline/dopamine (monoamines) and L-DOPA.[9] It exists in a cytosolic soluble form as well as a membrane-bound form, with the former being fairly distributed in the body; as assessed by erythrocyte COMT levels, rats may have more active COMT than humans,[10] as assessed by species differences in COMT inhibiting drugs.[11][12]


COMT is an enzyme that aims to inactivate several molecules in the body, in order to prevent their excessive elevation


All four green tea catechins appear to be a substrate for this enzyme, being methylated in the presence of incubated COMT.[13][14][15] At 1uM EGCG, it rapidly undergoes methylation and may be methylated once again to 4′,4"-dimethylEGCG, which is a slower methylation and its production can be greatly reduced with higher concentrations (3uM or more) of EGCG, the preferred substrate.[10]

Interestingly, catechins also appear to inhibit COMT as well as act as substrate for it. Flavonoids with a catechol B ring appear to be effective (such as rutin, isorhamnetin, and quercetin[16]) and EGCG has an IC50 value of 0.15-0.20uM in rat and mouse liver cells (in inhibiting EGC and L-DOPA, respectively);[10] this has been measured at 0.07uM in human liver cells.[17] In assessing the metabolites of EGCG, the first methylation product (4"-mEGCG) appears to be slightly more potent (IC50 0.1-0.16uM) than EGCG while the second metabolite (4′,4"-dmEGCG) is slightly less potent (0.2-0.3uM), the glucuronides were less potent on EGC and failed to inhibit methylation of L-DOPA; this inhibition applies to both human liver cells[17] and rodent liver cells.[10] Production has been noted in human endothelial cells as well.[18]

The inhibition is mixed-type in regards to EGCG and noncompetitive in regards to methylated derivatives.[10] In particular, EGCG that is twice methylated appears to compete with S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) for binding to COMT,[17] which is a product required for methylation of COMT subtrates (as SAMe donates the methyl group).[19]


Green tea catechins, particularly EGCG, appear to be both subject to being inactivated by COMT, but the catechins and their supposed inactivated forms can inhibit the enzyme from acting further


It has been hypothesized that inhibition of COMT by EGCG, which theoretically would lead to an increase of adrenaline, may underly fat burning effects of green tea. This is due to persons with a low-active genotype of COMT being highly associated with higher serum adrenaline levels at rest and exercise.[20]

COMT does appear to be of significance in vivo, as at least one study conducted on the vascular effects of green tea that noted nonsignificant results overall found highly significant results in the low-active COMT genotype subset; this study noted that blood pressure decreased only in the low-active genotype[21] and another noted that this may be due to favorable pharmacokinetics (less excretion in the urine, resulting in more time to affect the body).[22]

At least one study, however, has noted that week-long consumption of high dose catechins (1200mg) was unable to significantly influence adrenaline levels any differently than placebo at rest or during low-intensity exercise.[23]

2.2

NAPDH Oxidase

One study that noted suppression of oxygen radical release from HUVEC cells in vitro in response to oxidation (overall, an ant-oxidative effect) noted that this may have been due to NADPH Oxidase inhibition similar to Spirulina.[18] Essentially non-existent inhibition was seen with the base catechin and epicatechin molecules, but methylated metabolites (via COMT) had inhibitory values (IC50) of 15.1+/-4.1uM.[18] Other molecules tested that had inhibitory capacities on NAPDH oxidase were EGCG at 3.5+/-1.1uM, Procyanidin B2 (from Grape Seed Extract) at 3.8+/-0.8uM, various Quercetin derivatives (ranging from 4.6-12uM) and Resveratrol at 16.0+/-4.7uM.[18] Vitamin C, Trolox, and Aspirin were inactive.


NADPH oxidase inhibition can result in both antiinflammatory and antioxidative effects in a manner not related to the catechins directly scavenging free radicals


2.3

67-kDa Laminin Receptor

EGCG has been found to associated with the 67-kDa Laminin Receptor, a receptor highly expressed on some cancer cells and is associated with the risk of tumor invasion and metastasis,[24][25] with an estimated Kd of 39.9nM.[26]

3.

Pharmacology

3.1

Absorption

Intestinal uptake (bioavailability) of green tea catechins is low, ranging from 1.68% in humans[27] (similar in rats[28][29]) to up to 13-26.5% in mice.[30][28] This low intake is partially due to the physical structure of catechins (due to being a hydroxylated polyphenols) which form a large hydration shell; they are absorbed via passive diffusion (between intestinal cells) rather than via a transporter.[31] Catechin absorption is improved on an empty stomach for both pure EGCG[32] and a decaffeinated green tea extract containing multiple catechins.[33]

There is also a relatively large degree of immediate efflux due to rapid metabolism by glucuronidation enzymes (UGTs) contributing to this low bioavailability (mice),[34] and inhibiting these enzymes with piperine (from black pepper) appears to increase absorption of EGCG;[28] while an increase in bioavailability was not calculated in this study, both AUC (20-30%) and Cmax (10%)are increased while fecal EGCG indicative of malabsorption decreased to half or less.[28]


Green tea catechins, notably EGCG, seem to be poorly absorbed in the intestines mostly due to there not being a transporter that takes them up from the gut into the body. They are better absorbed on an empty stomach. Absorption might be able to be increased with piperine, but studies need to be conducted in rats or humans (since the animals used, mice, show interspecies differences when compared to humans)


Green Tea Catechins, primarily EGCG, are inhibitors of intestinal sulfurotransferase enzymes which may metabolize other supplements or drugs.[35] This property is shared with flavonoids found in green tea like Quercetin.[35] The inhibitory potential on this enzyme can also extend to the colon, and exert anti-carcinogenic effects on colonic tumor cells via inhibiting the metabolism of some procarcinogens.[36]

3.2

Transportation in Serum

One study using 400mg and 800mg EGCG with a light breakfast noted that >92% of circulating EGCG was in the free form[37] which has been replicated in other pharmacokinetic studies.[38] Interestingly, the higher dose of 800mg EGCG is associated with an increased half-life, suggesting either saturation of EGCG excretion or sufficient inhibition of COMT to preserve itself from methylation.[39] Taking EGCG fasted results in a higher Cmax (maximal amount to hit blood) of about 3.5-fold, and the overall AUC was greater fasted.[32] More significant differences are seen at lower dosages.[40]

Peak serum levels of green tea catechins (Tmax) tend to be around 2 hours after oral consumption, although they can be shifted sooner by consuming them in a fasted state[40][41][42] to around 60 minutes.[32]

In the fed state, 400mg, 800mg, and 1200mg EGCG result in an AUC (Area under Curve) of 36.7, 90.89 and 299.4min/ug/mL respectively, and in the fasted state result in 126.96, 254.48 and 685.53min/ug/mL respectively. A higher inter-individual variation exists.[40] The Cmax at the same dosages were 798.7+/-573.1, 1,522.4+/-1,357.8 and 3,371.6+/-1,651.2ng/mL fasted compared against 141.8±89.1, 294.0±113.5, and 923.6±755.3ng/mL; respectively.[40] Other studies note that a once daily oral dose of 400mg hits a Cmax of approximately 234.9+/-140.9ng/mL with a 24-hour AUC of 95.6+/-46.8min·μg/ml, and an 800mg dose hits a Cmax of 390.3+/-231.4ng/mL with the AUC as 145.6+/-85.1min·μg/ml.[37] Increasing the dosage to 1.5g has a Cmax (EGCG) of 326ug/mL whereas increasing the dose further to 3.0g increased the Cmax significnatly (2.5 to 3.4-fold) and shifted the Cmax to the left (sooner).[43]

Free EGC and EC are not detectable, as they exist as conjugated metabolites,[38] of either the sulfate or glucuronide variety.[41] Many conjugates may also be methylated, and up to 39 different combinations of catechin isomer, methylation status, and location of (or absent) conjugation to either sulfate or glucuronide have been ntoed.[41] The gallic acid moiety on ECG and EGCG seem to keep them in the free form, and prevent conjugation.

These amounts are the same whether green tea is administered as a pill or via decaffeinated tea. [38] The EC, EGC, and ECG do not affect (beneficially or adversely) the serum pharmacokinetics of EGCG, as assessed by EGCG versus mixed green tea catechins.[44][45]


Results show high variability, but suggest that there is a dose-dependent increase in circulating levels of EGCG. There seems to be a tipping point at around 800mg, where the amount in the blood then increases more dramatically. Very high doses of EGCG in the blood are associated with nausea.


3.3

Cellular Kinetics

Cellular concentrations of EGCG and related green tea catechins are regulated, in part, by Multidrug Resistance associated Proteins (MRPs).[46] They are not subject to P-Glycoprotein efflux[46]

3.4

Metabolism

EGCG can be formed into unique Cysteine derivatives (EGCG-2′-cysteine and EGCG-2′'-cysteine) when dosed near the toxicity threshold (200-400mg/kg injections); these are thought to possible play a role in toxicity.[47]

3.5

Elimination

Green tea catechins Epicatechin (EC) and Epigallocatechin (EGC) are excreted in the urine, as their serum conjugates are water soluble.[43] EGCG does not appear to be excreted in the urine.[43]

Another urinary metabolite known polyhydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactones, which are produced from colonic microflora, is also excreted in the urine after green tea consumption.[41] The two main valerolactins (M6 and M6') can be created from any catechin, and from EGC/EGCG respectively.[41][42] Thus, it is possible that unabsorbed catechins (which exist, due to low bioavailability) may still be bioactive not just in the colon but also as valerolactones.

In regards to excretion rate, at least one study that used repeated dosing of EGCG (92% purity) noted that after 10 days of 200mg supplementation that the AUC and Cmax was approximately 10% lower, suggesting enzymes in the elimination pathway are induced with chronic EGCG treatment; this trend was reversed at 400mg and significantly at 800mg.[39]

3.6

Genetic Variation

This may be a key to individual differences in green tea responsiveness, as COMT activity may be 40% reduced in some individuals via a genetic polymorphism.[48] However, these polymorphisms are not associated with the individual pharmacokinetics of Green Tea Catechins in vivo.[48]

It has been noted in one meta-analysis[49] that green tea was more effective in Asian populations for the purpose of weight management than it was in Caucasian populations, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.

4.

Cognition

4.1

Learning and Memory

Due to EGCG being able to easily cross the blood brain barrier[50] and (at 300mg) increasing brain activity up to 2 hours after ingestion, biological relevance for cognition has been investigated.[51] However, when subjects are measured a similar dose of 270mg was found to not influence mood or cognition.[52] A lower dose of 135mg EGCG reduced cerebral blood flow to the frontal cortex, but was not associated with lesser cognitive abilities.[52]

EGCG, when administed I.V to rats 60 minutes prior to a learning event (passive avoidance test); however, high doses were tested (and statistical significance seen at 15mg/kg bodyweight).[53] Lower dosages fed orally (0.5% of feed) for 8 weeks seems to improve memory in aged rats.[54] These results were replicated with injections of 10-20mg/kg, where an improvement in spatial memory was observed.[55]

Mechanistically, 5-40uM of EGCG has been shown to augment proliferation of adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro, although these concentrations were unable to induce differentiation with higher (80uM) concentrations still augmenting proliferation but actively inhibiting differentiation.[55] This was seen in vivo with 10-20mg/kg injections of EGCG in old rats.[55] An additional mechanism may be acetylcholinesterase inhibition, as less activity was noted in the brains of aged rats fed green tea catechins.[54] 


Green tea might be beneficial for cognition


4.2

Anxiety and Mood

In healthy persons, a single dose of 270mg EGCG was not found to influence mood in a positive or negative manner.[52]

In regards to anxiety, the primary catechin (EGCG) has been shown in vitro to negate negative modulation of GABA(A) receptors, and in vivo has reduced anxiety in rats in a dose dependent manner, although significance was seen at 30mg/kg bodyweight.[53]

However, L-Theanine seems to be able to potentiate anxiolytic effects and despite not reducing anxiety itself[56][57] can confer a reduction in anxiety when paired with Midozolam.[56] As EGCG has anxiolytic properties itself, the pair may be synergistic in reducing anxiety.[53]

4.3

Central Fatigue

In a mouse study on chronic fatigue syndrome, it was found that green tea at 25-100mg/kg bodyweight taken before forced swim tests was able to preserve physical performance in the fatigued state and acted to normalize some brain biomarkers that are changed by chronic stress; TNF-a and glutathione (increase and decrease; respectively).[58] Some other parameters of chronic fatigue, such as weight loss and spleen and thymus hypertrophy, were alleviated at 50 and 100mg/kg bodyweight.[58]

5.

Interactions with Cardiovascular Health

5.1

Atherosclerosis

Supplementation of Green Tea Catechins has been found to reliably increase the presence of catechins in the blood and overall antioxidative potential of the blood[59][60][61] which then leads to a reduction in LDL oxidation.[60] This has been noted with 5 g green tea powder[60] as well as 1,000 mg of gallated catechins (53.6% EGCG) where a 22% increase in the time for LDL to oxidize when tested ex vivo was found to be due to gallated catechins associating with LDL directly.[61]

When comparing the potency of green tea against other forms of tea it was noted to outperform barley, Eucommia ulmoides, and Gymnema sylvestre.[60]


Ingestion of high levels of green tea catechins seem to be able to reduce LDL oxidation, a factor in atherosclerosis, by nestling on the LDL particles and directly sequestering the radicals nearby


5.2

Blood Flow and Vasorelaxation

Green tea consumption (whole tea) has been reported in a meta-analysis to increase endothelium-mediated vasodilation.[62] At a median dose of 500mL daily, arterial diameter was increased 40% relative to control groups' or baselines' 6.3%.

A possible mechanism of action may be the green tea catechins' ability to increase Nitric Oxide bioavailability in vivo.[63] Possibly through increasing production of Nitric Oxide[64][65] through Akt-mediated NOS activation.[66] One study noted that the addition of milk to tea negated the cardioprotective effects mentioned here[67] but it has been criticized for taking only one measurement 2 hours after green tea ingestion;[68][69][70]

5.3

Cholesterol

Green tea catechins are potent inhibitors of the enzyme Squalene epoxidase, a rate limiting enzyme that turns squalene into cholesterol.[71] The effects on squalene epoxidase appear to be from binding to the enzyme through a C3 galloyl group, as galloyl esters appear to have this ability per se.[72] Additionally, its anti-oxidant effects can sequester oxygen that is required for the reaction mediated by squalene epoxidase to occur.[71]

6.

Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

6.1

Insulin

When taken alongside sucrose, black tea (containing Green Tea Catechins) at 110-220 mg does not appear to alter the insulin response in healthy and diabetic subjects[73] whereas another study pairing brewed green tea (300mL) with a light breakfast found that green tea did not alter the overall exposure to either insulin or glucose when compared to water.[74] One study has been conducted using an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) which found a benefit overall but to a mild degree with numerous individual differences (some patients seeing no change and others an elevation of blood glucose with green tea).[75]

When assessing how the catechins affect insulin after a meal in regards to COMT, whether the subject had a higher active or lower active COMT did not appear to matter when it came to elevations in insulin after a test meal.[76]


When investigating how green tea catechins affect insulin and glucose acutely (one dose taken alongside carbohydrates) it does not look like they have much benefit after a single dose.


When assessing studies using Green Tea Catechins in overweight and obese individuals who do not have type II diabetes, it was found that there was overall no effect of 843mg EGCG on fasting insulin levels after one year[77] although this may be due to differences in efficacy based on insulin level going into the study as, it was found, benefits may exist in subjects with a fasting insulin level exceeding 10 μIU/mL with no efficacy in subjects with lower insulin concentrations.[78] When assessing type II diabetics, green tea extract (500mg; 57% EGCG) appeared to show some benefit to insulin concentrations (although the decrease was not significantly different than placebo) with benefit to insulin resistance.[79]


While it is possible that some subjects with high fasting insulin concentrations may see benefit to green tea supplementation, overall it seems like there is not a major appreciable benefit in reducing insulin levels.


6.2

Insulin Sensitivity

Studies assessing Green Tea Catechins and insulin sensitivity have found in non-diabetic individuals no significant differences from placebo with both 300mg EGCG,[80] a nonsignificant trend towards improved insulin sensitivity in overweight women (960mL brewed; estimated 32.21mg EGCG),[81] and no effect with 500mg green tea extract (57% EGCG).[79] This seems to carry on with type II diabetics where no noticeable difference is seen across the entire group despite some responders[82] and in borderline diabetics/diabetics where 456mg catechins for two months showed a trend towards improving insulin sensitivity.[83]


When assessing human studies where green tea (in various forms) is given to either non-diabetic or diabetic subjects, supplementation does not appear to be associated with significant improvements in insulin sensitivity when compared to placebo.


COMT is an enzyme that, despite being considered the 'main' mechanism of how green tea catechins exert their effects, is present in the pancreas[84] and implicated in regulation of blood glucose. It has been noted to be suppressed in instances of diabetes in rodents due to high blood glucose[85] and high active COMT (G/G homozygous) seems to be more associated with insulin resistance and type II diabetes when compared to the lower active COMT enzymes (G/A heterozygous and A/A homozygous).[86] 

When looking at how the genotype interacts with Green Tea Catechins, it has been noted that postmenopausal women with COMT (G/G) see an increase in fasting insulin concentrations and reductions in adiponectin (a hormone from body fat that sensitizes the body to insulin[87]) although these changes did not result in a statistically significant increase in insulin resistance despite trending.[78] 


Inhibition of COMT in people with the high active variation of this enzyme shows trends to actually worsen insulin sensitivity, and may be a reason why there are differing levels of response to green tea and insulin/insulin sensitivity


6.3

Blood Glucose

When ingesting a black tea mixture (containing Green Tea Catechins) alongside sucrose, both 110 mg and 220 mg appear effective at suppressing the amount of glucose that enters the bloodstream over the next 60-120 minutes to a mild degree with no significant difference between doses; this effect occurred despite no apparent changes in insulin release.[73]

Green tea shows a favorable nutrient partitioning effect during times of carbohydrate metabolism, suppressing adipocyte GLUT4 translocation and stimulating myocyte GLUT4 translocation.[88] This benefit was noted from brewed green tea and not isolated catechins or EGCG.

7.

Obesity and Fat Mass

7.1

Mechanisms

Green tea affects thermogenesis via synergistically acting in concert with its caffeine content, and the addition of 300mg EGCG to 200mg caffeine can increase the thermic response to food more than 200mg caffeine.[89] Caffeine is able to increase noradrenaline levels in the body, which is synergistic with EGCG's ability to inhibit the enzyme catechol-o-methyl transferase(COMT)[10] which degrades catecholamines like noradrenaline[9] and methylates polyphenols. The end result of the pairing is higher levels of catecholamines induced by caffeine, and this synergism seems to be equipotent at various dosages of EGCG.[90] Caffeine also inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzyme, which degrades cAMP. It appears that this pathway (catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition) may be active in vivo.[91]

In studies with beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers) fat burning effects of green tea are reduced partially, suggesting that green tea exerts fat-burning effects via beta-adrenergic agonism and other means as well.[92]


Green tea can augment other fat burning compounds, usually through COMT inhibition. This does apply to endogenously produced adrenaline, so green tea taken in isolation could augment adrenaline's ability to increase the metabolic rate


7.2

Adipokines

When cells are incubated with EGCG, there are no significant changes with leptin and adiponectin secretion up to 48 hours.[93] Some studies note that green tea supplementation is associated with changing leptin levels in vivo[94][95] although this seems to be correlated but not causative.

7.3

Interactions with receptors/enzymes

All four catechins of green tea are effectively able to prevent adipocyte and preadipocyte differentiation when in the presence of a pro-differentiation (fat-gaining) stimuli.[94][96] The mechanisms by which Green tea acts is via suppressing multiple transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation such as PPAR-gamma2, SREBP1c and C/EBP-α, as well as reducing levels of the cell cycle regulator Cdk2 and Fox01.[96][97][98] EGCG is the most potent of the catechins in all the above regards. These effects carry over to the preadipocyte and can inhibit its differentiation.[99]

Many of the above enzyme changes have been noted in animal models, but seem to be associated with the complete tea extract ra
