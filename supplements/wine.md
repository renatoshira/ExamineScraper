Wine tends to contain the following, in varying dosages according to growing conditions and type of wine:


* [Resveratrol](/supplements/resveratrol/), a stilbene compound
* Resveratrol oligomers (ε-viniferin, α-viniferin, sophostilbene A, rhaponticin, piceatannol).[[2]](#ref2)
* [Alcohol](/supplements/alcohol/)
* The amino acid proline[[3]](#ref3) which acts with flavonol compounds to contribute bitter taste.[[4]](#ref4)
* Flavonol compounds like [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/), [Kaempferol](/supplements/kaempferol/), Isorhamnetin, and [Myricetin](/supplements/myricetin/) glycosides[[5]](#ref5)
* [Anthocyanins](/supplements/anthocyanins/) (in red wines), up to 45 different combinations of glycosides[[5]](#ref5)
* Flavanals, including the four [Green Tea Catechins](/supplements/green-tea-catechins/) and 4 other catechins.[[5]](#ref5)
* Cinnamic acids such as Fertaric acid, Ferulic acid and Chlorogenic acid[[5]](#ref5)
* Benzoic acids such as vanillic acid and protocatechuic acid (anthocyanin metabolite)[[5]](#ref5)
* Possible natamycin content, based on processing and usage to avoid Ochratoxin A contamination[[6]](#ref6)[[7]](#ref7)
* [Melatonin](/supplements/melatonin/) from the grapes[[8]](#ref8) as well as some serotonin[[9]](#ref9) The metabolite of serotonin, 5-HIAA, and the precursor, tryptophan, also exist in grapes and wine.
