Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound present in grapes, and is most well known for its presence in red wine. Interestingly, the popularity of resveratrol is due to its discovery in red wine and subsequent hypothesizing that it may be able to explain the 'French paradox' of Heart Disease.[15] However, resveratrol only contributes slightly to the french paradox, as alcohol (from red wine), diet and lifestyle are also significant factors.[16][17][18]

It is estimated to have an average intake of 0.2mg daily in a Spanish population,[19] mostly (98.4%) from wine. North Americans tend to have minute levels in the diet.

Interestingly, it is classified as a phytoalexin (plant toxin). Its reason for existence is to protect grapes from infection, as it is synthesized in response to Bothrytis cinerea infection.[20][21]


Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound referred to as a 'stilbene' due to its structure, and it is the most common and well researched stilbene currently known (despite stilbene's per se being a class of molecules). Stilbenes tend to be most well known for occurring in the Vitis family (Grape family) although they extend to many plants

Structure

Resveratrol can exist in one of two isomers: trans-resveratrol and cis-resveratrol. The configuration greatly changes the structure:

Trans-resveratrol is commonly seen as the active form of resveratrol. As the simple change results in a largely different molecule, many actions seen from trans-resveratrol are not seen with cis-resveratrol. These actions include modulation of the inflammation response,[29] and a more potent anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells.[30]

It should be noted that the cis isomer is still bioactive, but most research is focused on trans-resveratrol. Cis-resveratrol is still an anti-oxidant[31] and can interact with genetic transcription.[32]

1.3

Chemical Stability

When implemented into a gel base, trans-resveratrol stored at 4C does not convert into its cis isomer over a period of 30 days, suggesting possible usage as a topical ingredient.[33] Resveratrol is also poorly soluble in water[34] but many studies that use supplemental resveratrol on an empty stomach note that it can be absorbed without fatty acids.

Molecular Targets

2.1

Sirtuin System

Sirtuins are a class of 7 protein messengers in mammalian cells with a myriad of effects.[35] Specifically, they are NAD-dependent deacetylases; they deacetylase a wide variety of other compounds, and they use NAD (Nicotinamide Dinucleatide) to do this.[36] The enzyme (SIRT1) is induced (activated) in periods of fasting and is inhibited during high nicotinamide concentrations (correlated with feeding)[37] and, as prior research shows a link between SIRT1 and resveratrol, the above activation pattern of SIRT1 and caloric intake is the most famous hypothesized 'link' between longevity (via caloric restriction) and resveratrol.

The entire sirtuin family is highly involved with regulation of mitochondria[38] and energy metabolism,[39] and is a player in musclular energy metabolism in response to exercise.[40]


The sirtuin system is a group of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins that are involved in energy restriction and metabolism and thought to be related to aging, with activation of this system thought to promote longevity


2.2

Mitochondrial Biogenesis

Resveratrol has been noted to exert many actions in a manner that is dependent on SIRT1[41][42][43] and it was initially hypothesized that resveratrol allosterically modified SIRT1 to increase its affinity for substrate and NAD+ (directly increasing its activity[44]), although this is currently thought to not be the case since the fluorescent used in past research (Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide) may have been a research artefact (unintended mistake);[45][46][47] while a direct interaction isn't fully ruled out yet[48] it seems more likely that the influence on SIRT1 is indirect.


It seems unlikely that resveratrol directly activates SIRT1, although an activation of SIRT1 does appear to exist with resveratrol and it is currently thought to be downstream of directly influencing other molecular targets


Resveratrol may act on SIRT1 secondary to acting on AMPK in various tissues[49][50][51][52] which is thought to be due to AMPK increasing levels of NAD+ in a cell, which is the cofactor for SIRT1.[53] The opposite also holds true as abolishing SIRT1 activity prevents resveratrol from acting on AMPK,[54] and SIRT1 has the ability to deacetylate the AMPK kinase known as LKB1 which would increase AMPK activity[55][56] while abolishing SIRT1 prevents resveratrol from acting on AMPK.[54]

It was noted that AMPK was activated in a SIRT1 dependent manner at lower concentrations (25μM) but independent at higher concentrations (50μM) in C2C12 cells,[54] there is a possible pathway towards AMPK via phosphodiesterase inhibition since resveratrol inhibits PDE4 and PDE3 causing an increase in cAMP levels in the cell; increase cAMP will cause Epac1 to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and said calcium increases AMPK activity via the CamKKβ-AMPK pathway;[57] this was validated when Rolipram (selective PDE4 inhibitor) mimicked the effects of resveratrol.[57] Since the influence of SIRT1 on AMPK (deacetylation of LKB1) is that of a positive modulator, it is possible that PDE inhibition explains the direct AMPK activation while the lower concentrations indicate an alterate mechanism of resveratrol on SIRT1, which facilitates normally subactive concentrations of resveratrol on AMPK to then become active.

Regardless of the exact mechanisms, AMPK and SIRT1 both beneficially influence mitochondrial biogenesis[58][59] as since both SIRT1[60][61] and AMPK[62] promote the activity of PGC1α, which then promotes the transcription of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.[63] This pathway, however, has been noted to be primarily AMPK directly but dependent on SIRT1 (suggesting a positive modulator role).[59]


There is ultimately one shared result of activate SIRT1 and AMPK in a cell (increase in mitochondrial biogenesis secondary to PGC1α activatioN) although there appear to be two distinct pathways involved; it seems that resveratrol can directly activate AMPK via PDE inhibition at higher concentrations, and another influence on SIRT1 may positively regulate the AMPK pathway allowing it to occur at lower concentrations

Pharmacology

3.1

Bioavailability and Absorption

Resveratrol has a good absorption but low bioavailability when orally administered to man, as evidence by one study noting an oral dose of 25mg resulting in less than 5ug/mL in the serum while 0.2mg (125-fold lower) dose injected into serum resulted in levels of 16.4-30.7 ng/mL.[64] This is due to rapid conjugation via sulphation and glucuronidation (P450 enzymes) that reduce the amount of free resveratrol.[65]

There appears to be variation between individuals between dosages, which is less of a concern with low dosages and more of a concern with superloading. At an oral dose of 25mg there is merely a 2-fold difference in maximal differences[64] whereas at 5g a range of 52-2834 ng/g when measuring liver levels of resveratrol, and plasma levels varying from 800-5000ng/mL, exists.[66]

Interestingly, there is a circadian rhythm with resveratrol absorption. It appears the concentration of resveratrol in the blood is more dose-efficient (more bioavailable) in the morning relative to the PM,[67] which may be due to diurnal variations in one of the main system that metabolizes free resveratrol, P450 glucuronidation.[68] Additionally, enterohepatic circulation, which resveratrol is subject to[69] decreases in the morning.[70]

When consumed with a balanced meal, the overall bioavailability of Resveratrol does not change. However, the time until peak levels in the blood (Tmax) and the peak levels (Cmax) are delayed and reduced, respectively. Overall exposure (AUC) does not change with the balanced meal,[71] but may in response to a higher-fat meal (45g relative to 15g in the balanced meal).[72]


Its well absorbed in the intestines, and food does not affect its overall absorption. Bioavailability is another issue though, as conjugation begins at this stage.


3.2

Kinetics (Supplementation)

When ingested orally, resveratrol is taken up from the intestines to the liver (like any xenobiotic). It can be sulphated at either location[73] and it along with glucuronide conjugates account for up to 90% of serum resveratrol levels (the other 10% being free resveratrol)[74][75][76]. Coingestion with bioflavonoids causing competitive inhibition that may free up Resveratrol by having the other bioflavonoids act in a sacrificial manner,[77] specifically Quercetin.[78][65] However, at least one study using 500mg Quercetin and 2000mg trans-resveratrol noted no differences in resveratrol pharmacokinetics after co-ingestion of quercetin.

Dose dependence can be seen with capsules, with Cmax values of around 73ng/mL (100mg oral dose) 147ng/mL (1g oral) 268ng/mL (2.5g) and 534ng/mL (5g).[79] The larger doses gradually shifted the Tmax backwards towards 1.5 hours from 1 hour.[79] These dosages are relatively high, but lower have been studied; Cmax values have been noted at 1.48–3.83ng/mL (25mg) 6.59–7.39ng/mL (50mg) 21.4–23.1ng/mL (100mg) and 24.8–63.8ng/mL (150mg).[67] Tmax is harder to get from this study due to multiple dosing throughout the day.

In human trials with only trans-resveratrol, doses of 500mg resulted in a 24hour mean plasma concentration of 8.36ug/L and higher doses of 5g resulted in a 24 hour mean plasma concentration of 51.9ug/L; the Cmax was 72.6 μg/L at 50 minutes and 538.8 μg/L at 90 minutes, respectively.[79] These numbers are approximations, as there appears to be large inter-individual differences in the correlation between oral dose and blood levels.[80] The Cmax appears to follow loading parameters, and repeated dosages appear to induce subsequently higher levels of blood resveratrol.[81][82]

Micronized Resveratrol (SRT501) with particulate sizes of less than 5μm, the Cmax was found to be 8.51nmoL/L (1942 ng/mL) at 2.8 hours after oral ingestion.[66] A high inter-individual variation exists with this study noting a range of range 52-2834 ng/g when measuring liver levels of resveratrol, and plasma levels varying from 800-5000ng/mL.[66] These numbers appear to suggest that micronized resveratrol has a 3.6-fold increase in bioavailability[66] when compared to previous studies with non-micronized.[79]

3.3

Kinetics (Food products)

Resveratrol's absorption is relatively the same in ethanol as it is in water[83] and, as stated earlier, other bioflavonoids in wine act to increase the bioavailability of Resveratrol.[77] Thus, there is some synergism in absorption when consumed in the format of wine but this is not due to the alcohol content.

Consumption of 300mL of white wine can increase plasma levels in the range of 0.72±0.3 to 1.33±0.3umol/L and red wine in the range of 0.71±0.2 to 1.72±0.1 μmol/L.[84] As compiled in this review[65] other studies have been conducted on the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol after wine consumption. Three studies looked at 25mg of resveratrol consumption in the format of wine[85][83][86] and found, on average, a Cmax of 1.5-8ug/L (more often at the higher end) at 30 minutes after ingestion.

These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, as in addition to the high inter-individual variation trans-resveratrol also varies in content due to growing conditions for grapes.[87]


There appears to be no difference between the resveratrol in food and wine compared to capsule form. However, resveratrol has low bioavailability anyways at around 10% of ingested dose being bioactive. Food can have an advantage due to ingestion of compounds that increase bioavailability (like Quercetin) but capsules can be micronized to increased bioavailability 3.6-fold. Additionally, it would be hard to get very large dosages through wine without saying farewell to your liver (in regards to Alcohol)


3.4

Cytology (Cellular Kinetics)

Resveratrol appears to be readily taken up into cells, as evidenced by rapid serum depletion of resveratrol when injected into human subjects[64] and a robust accumulation into isolated cells (reponsive to resveratrol) within 10 minutes (the rate becoming more steady after 10 minutes).[88] The subcellular distribution of resveratrol after uptake appears to favor the membrane/organelle, with less concentration in the nucleus and less in the cytoskeleton and cytosol (the latter being equivalent).[88]

To travel through the blood, it may bind itself to albumin due to its structure[89] and incubation of free resveratrol with albumin in vitro causes a decrease in free resveratrol, from binding.[90] This binding affinity to albumin has been noted in other studies,[91] and appears to be enhanced when in the presence of fatty acids;[90] most likely due to structural changes of albumin when bound to fatty acids.[92]

Studies on HepG2 cells (liver cells) note that cellular uptake is mediated in part by passive diffusion and by carrier-mediated processes[93]

It has been quantified in vivo in gerbil brains[94] and human liver tissue[66] as well, demonstrating that it can diffuse into a cell. It has also been found in colon, lung, and heart tissue after oral administration.[95][96]

3.5

Metabolism

After ingestion of resveratrol, it can be conjugated by liver P450 enzymes. The results are resveratrol sulphate (via sulphation) and two glucuronides, resveratrol-O-glucuronide and resveratrol-C-glucuronide.[65]

Resveratrol has anti-oxidant properties, and when it sequesters oxidants (typically hydroxyl groups via dismutation) it can turn into one of four metabolites: piceatannol (PCT), 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA), 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (3,5-DHB) and para-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHB).[97]

3.6

Excretion

Resveratrol is excreted in both the urine and the feces. 

Half-life of the resveratrol molecule appears to be in the range of 1-3 hours, and can be extended slightly (2-5 hours) with multiple doses.[67]

Elimination half-life is estimated at being around 7-14 hours.[64]


In the end, resveratrol is readily absorbed and distributed to the body. It is mostly excreted within a day, and has a half-life of a few (1-3) hours. Blood levels are relatively dose-dependent, and the 'peak' level of blood concentration is slowly pushed backwards (up to 90 minutes, from 30) with the more resveratrol you consume. It can get into cells as well, when should preclude its metabolic actions. Its only real downfall is that it is heavily conjugated by the liver (P450)


4.

Longevity

4.1

Hypothesized Mechanisms

In Drosophilia and C.Elegans (two research creatures), the mechanism of longevity appears to be activation of Sirt2; a NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase protein.[98]
In Drosophilia, there appears to be interaction with both gender and diet with females on low-carbohydrate diets having benefit at the lowest dose resveratrol.[99]

As mentioned in the section on Sirtuins, these beneficially influences on the Sirtuin system may be vicariously through activation of AMPK.

Downregulation of p53 expression in neurons has also been shown to dose-dependently be associated with increasing lifespan in Drosophilia,[100][101] which is hypothesized to be downstream of the junction of interest.[102]

In a drosophilia genomic-wide analysis,[102] cross-referencing caloric restriction, Sirt2 long-living flies and p53 long-living flies, there came to be 21 genes that were shared between the three long-living creatures. These genes include takeout (expression related to food intake), which is related to Juvenile Hormone (insect-exclusive) and life-extension.[102][103] Of interest to humans is that the 21 overlapping genes had "relationships to chromatin structure, circadian rhythm, neural activity, detoxification/chaperone activity, muscle maintenance, immune function, growth factor activity and feeding behavior/response to starvation".[102]

Hypothesized mechanisms in mammals are various and were outlined in the Sirtuin section on 'Direct/Indirect influences'; less promosing than Drosophilia and C.Elegans mechanisms.

4.2

Studies in Drosophilia and C.Elegans

It appears that resveratrol reliably increases lifespan in these two non-mammalian models,[104][104][102][105][98] which may be related to acting on Juvenile Hormone; a longevity promoting yet insect exclusive hormone.[102][103]


In insect models (commonly used in longevity research as they have short lifespans and a study spanning an insects lifetime is actually practical to conduct and publish), resveratrol may promote lifespan by a mechanism that does not exist in humans


4.3

Studies in Mammals

In mammalian models of premature aging, resveratrol does not seem to be indicative of enhanced lifespan per se.[106][107][108][98] However, resveratrol is effective in inhibiting or reversing salient effects of aging (osteoporosis, sarcopenia, cognitive decline, etc.) and may give the illlusion of longer life or otherwise give life to your years rather than add years to your life.[76] In rats, these beneficial effects (parameters of aging) have been treated with doses as low as 4.9mg/kg bodyweight a day.[109]

It should be noted that this is not the consensus, and some studies do note increase longevity in lab animals.[110] However, it is currently up for debate whether the effects seen are due to a legitimate life extension mechanism or whether they protect from causes of death acutely (such as heart attacks) and push the median lifespan past statistical significance.


At this moment in time, it appears that resveratrol 'adds life to years' rather than 'adds years to life'. It may protect against common causes of death (covered in heart health and cancer metabolism) as well as metabolic syndrome, which could then push the median lifespan higher and exert a 'pseudo-life extension' appearance; however, a novel life extension mechanism independent of lifestyle that can be attributed to resveratrol appears to be lacking.


5.

Neurology

5.1

Neurokinetics

Resveratrol is able to cross the mammalian blood brain barrier, and incorporate itself into brain tissue.[94]

5.2

Cerebral Blood Flow

Resveratrol, at doses between 250-500mg of the trans-resveratrol isomer, have been noted to increase cerebral blood flow in healthy human subects.[111] This was not accompanied by an increase in cognitive performance.

5.3

glutamatergic Neurotransmission

Resveratrol may suppress glutamate release from neurons[112] although other evidence suggests that this does not occur.[113] Regardless of its effects presynaptically, resveratrol appears to attenuate glutamatergic activation of activated neurons[112][113][114] with an IC50 of 53.3+/-9.4µM which differntially affected glutamate receptors. 100µM of resveratrol inhibited AMPA currents (19.4+/-6.3%) less than NMDA (49.8+/-8.9%) and kainate (74.1+/-4.5%) with this inhibition was reversible.[113] Although it is not known why this occurs, it is thought that REDOX modulation may occur similar to pyrroloquinoline quinone (since it affects the NMDA but not AMPA receptors[115][116]) or that the known inhibition of L-type calcium channels.[117]

Other studies have noted that glutamate-induced changes (associated with excitotoxicity) are attenuated with resveratrol,[118][119] lending support for the suppressive effects on glutamatergic signalling.

At least one study noted that neuroprotection from resveratrol was abolished with an NMDA receptor antagonist,[120] which the authors thought reflected a preconditioning effect (as despite NMDA overactivation contributing to toxicity[121] a low level of activation preconditions the neurons and is neuroprotective[122]).


There are unclear effects of resveratrol on the glutaminergic receptors. While in general it appears to suppress overactivation of glutaminergic signalling (all three major receptor subsets), some neuroprotective effects appear to be prevented by blocking the receptor. It is possible that resveratrol is a weak agonist of sorts while outcompeting stronger agonists


In regards to seizures induced by kainic acid (acting via kainate receptors, one of the glutamate receptor isoforms), resveratrol appears to be able to reduce seizures and hippocampal neurotoxicity[123][124][125][126] although it appears ineffective in younger still developing rats[127] who are known to be more sensitive to kainate-induced seizures.[128]


May suppress the signalling through kainate receptors, and reduces the seizure potential of kainic acid. This appears to be well replicated in rat
