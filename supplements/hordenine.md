#### 1.1Sources and Structure


Hordenine (N,N-dimethyltyramine) is a protoalkaloid related to tyramine (known as *4-hydroxyphenethylamine* and derived from [L-Tyrosine](/supplements/l-tyrosine/)) that came to light after it appeared in the serum or horses fed sprouted barley (containing Hordenine) and indirectly acted as an adrenergic drug,[[1]](#ref1) although the doses found in their feed did not mimick the clear stimulant effects following injections.[[2]](#ref2) Other related structures include N-methyltyramine (a lone methyl group on the nitrogen atom) and Candicine, with three methyl groups on the nitrogen atom.


Hordenine can be found as a component of:


* Bitter Orange[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4)[[5]](#ref5)
* Barley, sprouted barley, and malt[[6]](#ref6)[[7]](#ref7)
* The *Galanthus* genera of plants[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9)
* The *Ariocarpus* (Cactus) genera of plants[[10]](#ref10)[[11]](#ref11)
* *Senecio scandens*[[12]](#ref12)
* *Pancratium maritimum*[[13]](#ref13)
* *Polyalthia longifolia*[[14]](#ref14)

Hordenine is one of the many biogenic amines in bitter orange that have since become dietary supplements, including [synephrine](/supplements/synephrine/) and [octopamine](/supplements/octopamine/).

### 2Pharmacology

#### 2.1Metabolism


Hordenine is subject to metabolism (deamination) via Monoamine Oxidase subset B (MAOB) with minimal metabolism by the MAO-A subset.[[15]](#ref15) This selective metabolism by MAO-B rather than MAO-A lessens the possible risk that is seem with the related structure Tyramine and Monoamine Oxidase inhibitors (known as the cheese effect, which leads to hypertensive crisises) which is more MAO-A dependent.[[16]](#ref16)


#### 2.2Drug Testing


Hordenine has been found to interact with Morphine testing drug kits, which extended to oxymorphone, hydromorphone and apomorphine with less reactivity to tests for etorphine- and buprenorphine; the authors suggested that high dose Hordenine can cause a false positive for Morphine and related structures.[[17]](#ref17)

### 3Neurology

#### 3.1Adrenaline


One study in isolated rat vas deferas muscles noted that Hordenine was able to augment adrenaline-induced contractions without inherently inducing contractions, suggesting it worked via acting as a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.[[15]](#ref15)[[18]](#ref18) This may be related to the clear adrenaline-like effects found after injections of 2mg/kg into horses (to reach serum levels of 1mcg/mL) which include a doubling of heart rate and induction of respiratory rate.[[2]](#ref2)
