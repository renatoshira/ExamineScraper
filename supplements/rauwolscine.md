### 1Fat-Burning Potential

Rauwolscine, or {3H}Rauwolscine, is an antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (more so the latter).[[1]](#ref1) This is the same mechanism by which yohimbine acts.

### 2Blood Vessel and Cardiac Health

{3H}Rauwolscine is less potent than [yohimbine](/supplements/yohimbine/) in protecting against adrenaline-induced blood pressure increases (both of which were less potent than corynanthine and more potent than 3-epi-alpha-yohimbine), this effect seems related to their affinity for the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor.[[2]](#ref2)

### 3Serotonergic Effects

Like yohimbine, rauwolscine is an agonist of 5-HT1a/b receptors and induce serotonin-like effects. While yohimbine has more affinity for the receptor, rauwolscine has a lower IC50 value (meaning it can saturate more receptors at the same dose) and can be seen as slightly more potent in serotonergic activity.[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4)Rauwolscine: an antagonist radioligand for the cloned human 5-hydroxytryptamine2b (5-HT2B) receptor|published=1998 Jan|authors=Wainscott DB, Sasso DA, Kursar JD, Baez M, Lucaites VL, Nelson DL|journal=Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol]
