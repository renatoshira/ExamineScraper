Effects in the Brain

Centrophenoxine is able to reverse lipofuscin/beta-amyloid pigmentation build-up as well as act as an anti-oxidant against lipid peroxidation.[1] Centrophenoxine can also increase RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and glucose uptake in neurons and glial (support) cells. These latter effects are, however, dependent on the reductions of lipofuscin build-up[2] and don't appear to affect youth with no lipofuscin build-up.[3]

2.

Dementia

Centrophenoxine has been shown to be efficacious in treating dementia by increasing intracellular water content (of which dehydration is consistent with aging) and by increasing skills on cognition testing after 8 weeks of a 2g dose.[4]

Teratogenicity

Centrophenoxine, via its DMAE moiety, may act as a teratogen in the same manner as DMAE which can be reviewed under DMAE's Teratogenic Summary
