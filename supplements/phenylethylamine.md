### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources and Structure


β-phenylethylamine (*2-phenylethylamine*) is a small amine containing alkaloid synonymous with phenethylamine and the acronym PEA; in the human body it has a neurotransmitter role[[1]](#ref1) and is known as a trace amine due to its low quantity relative to other bioactive amino acids.[[2]](#ref2)


Structurally speaking, the basic phenethylamine backbone (*2-phenylethylamine*) contains a benzene ring with a lone nitrogen group bound via a short two-carbon chain; if a methylation were to occur at the final carbon that is attached to the nitrogen group then the resulting backbone is the base amphetamine structure.[[1]](#ref1) The phenylethylamine backbone differs from catecholamines due to having no hydroxylations on its backbone, and synthetic modifications of the backbone with hydroxylations and methylation results in a variety of phenylethylamine-based hallucinogenic drugs (ie. mescaline).

β-phenylethylamine can also be produced from dietary L-phenylalanine which is estimated to be around 4g in the average diet (due to it being a component of dietary protein),[[7]](#ref7) although not all L-phenylalanine is destined to produce β-phenylethylamine as it can be converted into [L-Tyrosine](/supplements/l-tyrosine/) via *phenylalanine hydroxylase*.[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9)


#### 1.2Physicochemical Properties


β-phenylethylamine has a molar mass of 121.17964 g/mol and has high solubility in double distilled water (ddH2O) and in plasma, although low solubility in lipid.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 1.3Biological Significance


β-phenylethylamine is produced in the human body after a decarboxylation process from the amino acid L-phenylalanine,[[1]](#ref1) known to be mediated by *aromatic amino acid decarboxylase* (AADC).[[10]](#ref10)


β-phenylethylamine is produced from L-phenylalanine, which is also known to by converted into [L-Tyrosine](/supplements/l-tyrosine/) via the *phenylalanine hydroxylase* enzyme.[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9) Chronic inhibition of this enzyme or genetic insufficiency results in a backlog of L-phenylalanine, resulting in a form of hyperphenylalaninemia[[11]](#ref11) and is involved in some cases of phenylketonuria (PKU).[[12]](#ref12) Persons in this situation tend to be more sensitive to most biogenic amines including β-phenylethylamine.


#### 1.4Formulations and Variants


R-β-Methylphenylethylamine (*1-amino-2-phenylpropane*), also known simply as β-Methylphenethylamine or β-Me-PEA, is a PEA structure where a methyl group occurs on the first carbon extending out from the benzene backbone; due to the carbon being placed here rather than the second carbon out, it is not classified as an amphetamine and has been isolated from the leaves of *acacia berlandieri* (Guajillo; not the pepper).[[13]](#ref13)[[14]](#ref14)


N-Methylphenethylamine (NMPEA; *N-Methyl-β-phenylethylamine*) is a differently structured metabolite of PEA where the methylation occurs on the amine itself, and NMPEA is also not classified as an amphetamine.[[15]](#ref15)

> There are two variations of the basic phenylethylamine structure involving methylation, but neither of which are methylated on the second carbon (which would be an amphetamine); one methylates on the first carbon from the benzene ring whereas the other directly methylates the amine group

### 2Molecular Targets

#### 2.1Trace Amine Receptors


A collection of intracellular receptors known as *trace amine-associated receptors* (TAARs) or simply *trace amine* (TA) receptors are known to respond to the variety of amino acids known as trace amines.[[16]](#ref16) These receptors are known to be expressed in both rats and humans although their response to drugs may differ[[17]](#ref17) due to somewhat low homology (76–78%)[[18]](#ref18)[[19]](#ref19) although recombinant human TAARs (rhTAAR) and human TAAR (hTAAR) have high homology (96.9%).[[20]](#ref20) These receptors are intracellular[[21]](#ref21) and associated with the membrane fraction of cells excluding the cell surface membrane despite their similarities to adrenergic receptors (which are at the cell surface membrane),[[22]](#ref22) thought to be due to the nine-amino acid long proximal terminal of adrenergic receptors which, when added to TAAR1, can stabilize it in the cell surface membrane.[[23]](#ref23)



> Trace amine receptors are intracellular receptors which respond to the neurotransmitters that are in lower amounts without their own receptors. These neurotransmitters include tyramine, tryptamine, octopamine, β-phenylethylamine, and 3-Iodothyronamine amongst others, and this signalling pathway highly interacts with catecholamine (dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline) signalling


The TA1 receptor (also known as TAAR1[[24]](#ref24)) is a G-protein coupled receptor with structural hallmarks that parallel the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor superfamily[[2]](#ref2) that responds to trace amines including tyramine and β-phenylethylamine, and after binding produces cAMP.[[18]](#ref18) TA2 (aka. GPR58 or TAAR2[[25]](#ref25)) is a similar receptor that also responds to β-phenylethylamine but instead of tyramine it responds to tryptamine,[[18]](#ref18) and both the TA1 and TA2 receptors have mRNA expressed in brain regions (*substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area*, *locus coeruleus*, and *dorsal raphe nucleus*) where β-phenylethylamine is known to exert catecholaminergic activity.[[18]](#ref18)


This receptor (TA1) is known to have a baseline activity without any ligand, and β-phenylethylamine is more potent than other TA1 agonists (tyramine and octopamine) at inducing cAMP a concentration of 1µM (but comparable at 100nM or less).[[26]](#ref26)


These trace amine receptors are also known to be a molecular target of entactogenic drugs such as amphetamine, tenamphetamine (Molly), LSD,[[21]](#ref21) Mescaline, MDMA,[[20]](#ref20) and endogenous hallucinogens.[[27]](#ref27)



> β-phenylethylamine is an endogenous agonist at the TA1 and TA2 receptors, with slightly more potency than other trace amines. Actions at this receptor are thought to explain the roles of β-phenylethylamine in interacting with adrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission


#### 2.2Monoamine Transporters


Secondary to the activation of TA1 (previous section) β-phenylethylamine has been noted to both reduce the uptake of and increase efflux of various neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline in brain synaptosomes at 0.1-1μM (no activity at 10nM);[[28]](#ref28) this did not occur in cells where TA1 was genetically ablated, was unrelated to autoreceptor function (which regulate receptor function[[29]](#ref29)[[30]](#ref30)) and the efflux was blocked by inhibiting the transporters.[[28]](#ref28)

### 3Pharmacology

#### 3.1Neurological Distribution


β-phenylethylamine (PEA) is a naturally occurring biogenic amine in the mammalian brain although it is considered trace as its overall amount totals around 1-5% of the level of catecholamines, thought to be due to limited synthesis with rapid metabolism.[[31]](#ref31)[[32]](#ref32)[[33]](#ref33) Injections of β-phenylethylamine in the periphery seem to be taken up in most brain areas evenly,[[34]](#ref34) and at rest β-phenylethylamine seems to be spread across most brain regions although highest levels are in areas with a higher catecholamine presence (nigrostriatal and mesolimbic regions such as the *caudate–putamen*, *olfactory tubercles* and *nucleus accumbens*).[[10]](#ref10)


β-phenylethylamine appears to cross the blood brain barrier after arterial injection[[35]](#ref35) showing a brain uptake index of 83+/-6% (water as reference at 100%) comparable to amphetamine and suggesting passive diffusion rather than transporter-mediated uptake.[[34]](#ref34)


Within the brain (not serum), β-phenylethylamine is estimated to have a half-life of around half a minute due to rapid metabolism by MAO enzymes (primarily MAO-B).[[7]](#ref7)


#### 3.2Cellular Kinetics


β-phenylethylamine is known to be a substrate of the dopamine transporter (DAT), and overexpressing DAT in cells increases β-phenylethylamine uptake[[20]](#ref20) and its actions on its molecular target (TA1)[[20]](#ref20) while blocking the DAT can inhibit some TA1-dependent actions of β-phenylethylamine.[[36]](#ref36)


#### 3.3Metabolism


β-phenylethylamine (PEA) is primarily metabolized by the *monoamine oxidase B* enzyme (MAO-B)[[37]](#ref37) although both enzymes have the potential to metabolize it.[[38]](#ref38) This deamination process by MAO enzymes results in production of the byproduct phenylacetic acid[[39]](#ref39) and at least neurologically it does not appear to be active in the same way β-phenylethylamine is.[[40]](#ref40)


Based on studies injecting β-phenylethylamine into the dog, the half-life of PEA appeared to be in the range of 6-16 minutes depending on dose[[15]](#ref15) and N-methyl-β-phenylethylamine (NMPEA) appears to follow suit in this rapid metabolism[[15]](#ref15) and is also a known substrate for MAO-B.[[41]](#ref41)



> β-phenylethylamine appears to be primarily metabolized by MAO-B, and this metabolism appears to occur quite rapidly in serum


Interconversions may also happen in cells, as nonspecific N-methyltransferase enzymes can convert β-phenylethylamine into N-Methylphenethylamine (NMPEA) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase can convert PEA into a *phenylethanolamine* (PEOH);[[33]](#ref33)[[42]](#ref42) PEOH can be further methylated by the specific enzyme *phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase* (PNMT) which is the enzyme that converts noradrenaline into adrenaline.[[43]](#ref43)[[44]](#ref44) It should be noted that PEOH is also a substrate for both MAO enzymes[[45]](#ref45) with specificity for MAO-B.[[46]](#ref46)



> β-phenylethylamine produced in neurons (from L-phenylalanine) can be used by alternate enzymes as an intermediate in a few pathways involved in neurotransmission

### 4Neurology

#### 4.1Adrenergic Neurotransmission


Catecholaminergic neurons tend to express a high level of *aromatic amino acid decarboxylase* (AADC) which produces β-phenylethylamine (PEA) from its parent amino acid L-phenylalanine, while the enzyme of metabolism (MAO-B) tends to be expressed in high levels in astrocytes[[47]](#ref47) but there was a failure to express high levels of MAO-B in catecholaminrgic neurons (locus coeruleus and substantia nigra) despite detecting MAO-B in serotonergic neurons.[[47]](#ref47) This has been interpreted as a potential higher concentration of PEA within catecholaminergic neurons than is generally assumed based on assessing brain wet weight.[[7]](#ref7)



> The enzymes of β-phenylethylamine synthesis are located alongside those of catecholamine synthesis, and due to a relatively lower amount of its enzyme of metabolism in cells that have a high noradrenergic presence it is thought to accumulate to a degree and be more intracellularly active in these brain regions


At the level of the adrenergic receptor, β-phenylethylamine (and tyramine) are partial allosteric antagonists of both the β1 and β2[[26]](#ref26) (noncompetitive against the agonist isoprenaline[[21]](#ref21)) with an Emax of 403+/-54nM.[[26]](#ref26)


PEA is thought to be an antagonist at the α-adrenergic receptor albeit at impractically high concentrations (100µM).[[48]](#ref48)



> At the level of the adrenergic receptors, β-phenylethylamine appears to be an allosteric and partial inhibitor


#### 4.2Dopaminergic Neurotransmission


β-phenylethylamine synthesis rates in dopaminergic neurons parallel that of dopamine, although striatal concentrations seem to be about 3-fold lower due to elevated MAO-B metabolism.[[10]](#ref10)



> β-phenylethylamine appears to be localized around dopaminergic neurons, although it is at a lower concentration than dopamine due to its rapid metabolism by MAO-B


β-phenylethylamine has been noted to increase dopamine secretion when taken up into dopaminergic neurons, secondary to the dopamine transporter (DAT; as blocking the transporter ablates the effects of PEA);[[36]](#ref36) the vesicular monoamine transporter not playing a role *in vitro*[[36]](#ref36) and the VMAT inhibitor reserpine not blocking the dopaminergic actions of β-phenylethylamine.[[49]](#ref49) This may be due to β-phenylethylamine being a substrate for DAT, and increasing dopamine secretion secondary to TA1 activation.[[28]](#ref28) Similar to the actions expected of a TA1 agonist, β-phenylethylamine has been repeatedly shown to induce dopamine secretion *in vitro*[[50]](#ref50) and *in vivo*[[51]](#ref51)[[52]](#ref52) and to inhibit dopamine uptake.[[53]](#ref53)[[54]](#ref54)


β-phenylethylamine appears to have an additional role in activating the D2 autoreceptor at physiological concentrations, acting to regulate excessive firing.[[55]](#ref55)[[56]](#ref56)



> Secondary to activation of the trace amine receptor (TA1), β-phenylethylamine appears to cause an increase in dopamine efflux paired with a reduction in dopamine uptake into neurons


#### 4.3Serotonergic Neurotransmission


β-phenylethylamine appears to be 100-fold less potent in releasing serotonin from the nuclear accumbens when compared to its ability to release dopamine when tested in the range of 1-100µM.[[57]](#ref57)


Serotonergic neurons appear to express MAO-B within the neuron, unlike catecholaminergic neurons,[[47]](#ref47) suggesting that accumulation of β-phenylethylamine within the neuron is not as relevant.[[7]](#ref7)


#### 4.4Addiction and Obsession


β-phenylethylamine is thought to be related to addiction since, in the treatment of cocaine addiction, 'agonist therapy' (using agents that increase synaptic dopamine) appear to be beneficial[[58]](#ref58)[[59]](#ref59) but pure dopaminergic agonists have their own addictive potential due to activation of the mesolimbic reward pathway. As serotonin suppresses this particular aspect of dopaminergic activity,[[60]](#ref60)[[61]](#ref61) mixed agonists acting on both serotonin and dopamine are thought to be beneficial for the treatment of stimulant and [alcohol](/supplements/alcohol/) addiction;[[62]](#ref62)[[63]](#ref63) β-phenylethylamine is known to possess agonistic properties towards both of these neurotransmitters.


#### 4.5Depression


In subjects exercising on a treadmill for half an hour at 70% of their maximal heart rate (in the middle of the 60-80% range where increases in mood are reported[[64]](#ref64)) the amount of phenylacetic acid in the urine was increased albeit to a highly variable degree; this was thought to be a possible factor in the anti-depressant actions of exercise.[[65]](#ref65)

### 5Inflammation and Immunology

#### 5.1Immunosuppression


The trace amine receptors that β-phenylethylamine is known to influence (TAAR1 and 2) appear to be expressed on leukocytes[[66]](#ref66) as well as both T and B cells,[[25]](#ref25) and activation of both receptors by β-phenylethylamine at an EC50 of 0.52+/-0.05nM causes chemotaxis of the immune cells;[[25]](#ref25) this is a concentration already lower than human plasma at rest (14.5nM[[67]](#ref67)) and thus appears to be physiologically relevant. Similar actions were also noted with the trace amines T1AM (*3-Monoiodothyronamine*, EC50 0.25+/-0.04nM[[25]](#ref25)) and tyramine (0.52+/-0.05 nM[[25]](#ref25)) which are also within physiological concentrations.[[67]](#ref67)



> Trace amino acids appear to be able to influence leukocyte migration at a concentration which is relevant even without nutritional supplementation


#### 5.2Natural Killer Cells


TAAR1 and TAAR2 do not appear to be highly expressed in natural killer cells.[[25]](#ref25)


#### 5.3Bacterial Interactions


β-phenylethylamine has been able to reduce biofilm and microbial cell count from *E. coli* O157:H7 when incubated with infected meat products, a potency seemingly greater than most other agents tested.[[68]](#ref68)


[Back to top](#c-inflammation-and-immunology)
### 6Interactions with Hormones

#### 6.1Prolactin


Trace amines, including [octopamine](/supplements/octopamine/)[[69]](#ref69)[[70]](#ref70) and *p*-tyramine (59% inhibition at 1µM,[[70]](#ref70) some efficacy at 10nM[[69]](#ref69)) as well as phenylethylamine can inhibit prolactin secretion. The inhibitory effects of phenylethylamine are dose-dependent in the range of 10nM upwards to 10µM,[[69]](#ref69) and while this effect requires dopamine receptors to be functioning[[69]](#ref69) trace amines do not displace dopamine receptor ligands at this concentration.[[70]](#ref70)[[69]](#ref69) It is thought that trace amines cause a secretion of dopamine which then acts on its receptors to reduce prolactin (a known phenomena[[71]](#ref71)).

### 7Other Medical Conditions

#### 7.1Parkinson's Disease


Parkinson's Disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by dopaminergic insufficiency and degeneration in the brain region known as the substantia nigra, resulting in a loss of function in the nigrostriatal pathway and dopamine content of the caudate-putamen.[[72]](#ref72) The nigrostriatal pathway locally synthesizes[[73]](#ref73)[[74]](#ref74) and is modulated[[49]](#ref49) by trace amines such as β-phenylethylamine.


One study noted a negative correlation between cerebrospinal fluid content of β-phenylethylamine and the severity of Parkinson's disease as assessed by Hoehn and Yahr stage[[75]](#ref75) although a later study assessing serum β-phenylethylamine failed to replicate this correlation with disease severity although PD *per se* had a significantly lower serum level of this trace amine (48%).[[76]](#ref76)



> β-phenylethylamine is synthesized in and acts on the brain region which is known to dysfunction during Parkinson's disease, and accordingly concentrations of β-phenylethylamine in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid appear to be reduced during Parkinson's Disease


[Back to top](#c-other-medical-conditions)
### 8Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions

#### 8.1Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors


β-phenylethylamine (PEA) is metabolized by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and inhibiting these enzymes in the presence of PEA has been noted to cause effects attributed to PEA that did not otherwise occur without inhibition of its metabolism.[[77]](#ref77)


A condition known as 'cheese syndrome' or the 'cheese effect' is known to occur with high intake of cheese (conferring dietary tyramine) and chocolate (conferring dietary β-phenylethylamine) in persons who are using MAO inhibitors, where the combination results in a potentially dangerous increase in blood pressure.[[78]](#ref78)[[79]](#ref79) It appears that selective inhibition of MAO-B is not a risk, but selective inhibition of MAO-A and mixed inhibition is.[[78]](#ref78)


#### 8.2Amphetamine


Mechanistically, β-phenylethylamine has been suggested to potentiate amphetamine-like actions in a manner *not* related to endogenous noradrenaline.[[40]](#ref40)


As amphetamine is known to rapidly increase dopamine transporter trafficking to the cell surface[[80]](#ref80)[[81]](#ref81) (although afterwards promoting receptor internalization[[82]](#ref82)[[83]](#ref83)) and the effects of β-phenylethylamine on dopamine secretion depend on this transporter,[[36]](#ref36) it is thought to be a possible level for interaction and may preclude long term synergism (as the increased DAT expression does not last after one hour[[84]](#ref84)[[82]](#ref82)).
