### 1Sources and Composition

The cactus pear fruit is a member of the *Cactaceae* family and is a common vegetation in Mexico, the Mediterranean, and much of Southern America. They come in a variety of colors ranging from red to yellow to white, which is due to varying combinations of the red-purple pigment *betalain* and the yellow-orange pigment *indicaxanthin*.[[1]](#ref1)


Cactus Pear Fruit contains:


* [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c/)
* The betalains 'betanin' and 'indicaxanthin'[[1]](#ref1)
* The soluble fiber 'pectin'[[2]](#ref2)

Yellow cactus pear is much higher in betanin pigments, whereas red fruits are higher in indicaxanthin. The former can reach ratios of 1:8 Betanin:Indicaxanthin whereas the latter can reach 2:1 ratios.[[1]](#ref1)[[3]](#ref3) White fruits tend to have the greatest anti-oxidant fighting capabilities.[[1]](#ref1)

### 2Effects on heart health

#### 2.1Interactions with blood glucose


Cactus pear fruit (specifically, the species *Opuntia Ficus Indica*), in the dose of 500g of the fruit, appears to be able to reduce post-prandial (after meal) blood sugar levels.[[4]](#ref4) The compound(s) causative of the benefit appear to not be affected by varying preparation methods and seem to be heat stable up to 60°C and is the Cactus Fruit more commonly used in meal preparation.[[4]](#ref4)


The less palatable species *Opuntia streptacantha* has a well established role as being protective against diet-induced diabetes by controlling blood sugar levels.[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6)|published=1989 Apr-Jun|authors=Frati-Munari AC, Del Valle-Martínez LM, Ariza-Andraca CR, Islas-Andrade S, Chávez-Negrete A|journal=Arch Invest Med (Mex)][[7]](#ref7)[[8]](#ref8) However, these beneficial effects may not occur in healthy persons[[9]](#ref9)[[10]](#ref10) and supplemental forms typically underdose.[[11]](#ref11)|published=1992 Jul-Aug|authors=Frati Munari AC, Vera Lastra O, Ariza Andraca CR|journal=Gac Med Mex]


#### 2.2Interactions with serum lipids


Cactus pear appears to be able to reverse suppression of the LDL receptors in the liver that are commonly expressed in cases of high cholesterol.[[2]](#ref2) It does not affect cholesterol absorption from the diet like many soluble fibers[[12]](#ref12) but seems to be able to reduce serum cholesterol vicariously through the formerly described mechanism.[[13]](#ref13)[[2]](#ref2)


#### 2.3Anti-oxidation


In a comparitive study against vitamin C (a standard of which anti-oxidants are tested against), Cactus pear fruit (250g pulp) was able to beneficially affect various markers of oxidation whereas vitamin C was not.[[14]](#ref14)
