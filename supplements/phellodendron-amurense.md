### 1Sources and Components

#### 1.1Sources


Phellodendron amurense (Henceforth PA) is tree from the overarching family *Rutaceae*. It is more specifically known as 'Amur Cork Tree' and is known as one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.[[1]](#ref1)


A supplement known as 'Cortex Phellodendri' may be sold and, if the species is unspecified, may be a combination of both the species *P. Amurense* as well as *P. Chinensis*.[[1]](#ref1) These plants are similar for the most part, but the *Chinensis* species possesses a higher [berberine](/supplements/berberine/) (360% higher) and anti-oxidant (28% higher) content while the species *Amurense* possesses a higher total protoberberine alkaloid (25% higher) and flavonoid (11% higher) content; *Chinensis* contains mostly only Berberine in the protoberberine alkaloid class.[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3) There is not too much practical difference between the two, although only *Chinensis* is implicated in slowing down intestinal motility.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 1.2Composition


As a herbal supplement, Phellodendron Amurense contains a variety of compounds including:


* [Berberine](/supplements/berberine/)[[4]](#ref4)
* Jatrorrhizine[[4]](#ref4)
* [Palmatine](/supplements/palmatine/)[[4]](#ref4)
* Phellodendrine[[5]](#ref5)
* Limonoids such as Limonin and Obakunone[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6)[[4]](#ref4)
* (9Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid (Oleic Acid)[[7]](#ref7)

### 2Interactions with fat metabolism

Phellodendron amurense (PA) has been noted to have beta-2-adrenergic agonistic properties[[8]](#ref8) with an EC(50) 50% higher than the plant which bears [Synephrine](/supplements/synephrine/) (denoting more of a dose needed to achieve the same effects).

### 3Joint and Bone health

Phellodendron amurense (PA) has been shown in humans to alleviate pain associated with osteoarthritis[[9]](#ref9) perhaps through alleviating inflammation's (IL-1a) degradative effects on sulfated glycosaminoglycan in joints.[[10]](#ref10)


The component berberine has been shown to promote osteoblast differentiation, leading it to possible be an adjunct treatment for bone health.[[11]](#ref11)Â

### 4Interactions with Neurology

Phellodendron Amurense has been implicated in preserving neural function at 100-200mg/kg bodyweight (IP injections) in rats administered scopolamine, an anticholinergic research toxin.[[12]](#ref12) Benefit was seen with both Phellodendron as well as one of its components, [Berberine](/supplements/berberine/), in isolation.[[12]](#ref12) 200mg/kg bodyweight Phellodendron showed similar effects to the group not given scopolamine, and the group given Phellodendron without the toxin did not experience enhanced effects; suggesting a recovery of deficit but not unilateral improvement.[[12]](#ref12)

### 5Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial effects

Many anti-oxidant effects of PA are mediated vicariously through an increase in *in vivo* glutathione levels via stimulation of the Glutathione S-Transferase enzyme via a peptide found in PA.[[13]](#ref13)


The anti-microbial activity of *Phellodendron Amurense* is most likely due to its protoberberine content and high [Berberine](/supplements/berberine/) content relative to other herbs.

### 6Interactions with Hormones

#### 6.1Estrogen


In a screening of medicinal herbs for estrogenicity, Phellodendron Amurense failed to exert any estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects in concentrations below 1mg/mL.[[14]](#ref14)

### 7Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions

#### 7.1Magnolia Officinalis and Relora


A patented combination of Phellodendron Amurense and [Magnolia Officinalis](/supplements/magnolia-officinalis/) is known as 'Relora', known for its properties of stress and anxiety reduction.[[15]](#ref15)[[16]](#ref16)[[17]](#ref17) Although preliminary, it shows promise in reducing overeating related to stress, an effect similar to that of [Rhodiola Rosea](/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/).[[17]](#ref17)
