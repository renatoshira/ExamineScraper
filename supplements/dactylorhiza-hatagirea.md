#### 1.1Sources


*Dactylorhiza hatagirea* (from the orchid family *orchidaceae* and synonymous with *Orchis macula*[[1]](#ref1)) is an [aphrodisiac](/supplements/aphrodisiac/) herb from [Ayurveda](/supplements/ayurveda/) and native to the Himilaya region (of altitudes of around ); it is known as a *Vajikaran* due to its reported ability to enhance male virility and strength.[[2]](#ref2) This plant is known in the local and surrounding regions by various names such as *Hatta Haddi*, *Salam Panja*, *Wang lak*, *Lovha*, *Hathejadi*, *Panchaule*, and *Airula*;[[3]](#ref3) it is medicinally used as a juice where it is drank to heal wounds, cuts, and gastritis[[3]](#ref3) beyond its usage as a sexual stimulant.[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)



> A basic history similar to most Vajikaran herbs, appears to be used to some limited medicinal purposes but most is just used as a sexual stimulant for men

### 4Sexuality and Pregnancy

#### 4.1Libido


200mg/kg of a lysophilized extract of the roots of *dactylorhiza hatagirea* for 28 days is able to enhance male rat attraction towards females (2.5-fold) and was able to modify mount latency (36% reduction) and post-ejaculatory latency (36%) in a manner suggesting libido enhancement.[[1]](#ref1)


There is an increase in the penile erection index seen with 100mg/kg of *dactylorhiza hatagirea* (defatted water extract) daily for two weeks to rats, although this was less than the benefit seen with *Curculigo orchioides* and [Chlorophytum borivilianum](/supplements/chlorophytum-borivilianum/).[[2]](#ref2) This has been noted elsewhere with 200mg/kg of the root water extract over 28 days.[[1]](#ref1)



> Appears to have libido enhance properties, and when compared against other ayuvedic herbs on the penile erection index it appeared to be less potent


#### 4.2Fertility


In male rats, 100mg/kg of a defatted water extract of *dactylorhiza hatagirea* given orally over the course of two weeks was able to increase sperm count by 28.22%;[[2]](#ref2) a potency comparable to the same dosage of [Chlorophytum borivilianum](/supplements/chlorophytum-borivilianum/), [Asparagus racemosus](/supplements/asparagus-racemosus/), and *Curculigo orchioides*[[2]](#ref2) but was not associated with increased fructose content of the spermatids.



> The ability of this herb to increase sperm count is comparable to other ayurvedic herbs, although it appears less effective at increasing nutritional parameters of the sperm (ie. fructose content)
