### 1Source and structure

Chondroitin sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan chain of alternating Uronic acids and D-N-acetyl-galactosamine molecules bound by 1,3 bonds.[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2) They are produced in vivo to limited amounts and were initially extracted from animal sources, but are now industrially made via bacterial fermentation.[[3]](#ref3)

### 2Pharmacology

#### 2.1Absorption


Chondroitin supplementation is absorbed fairly well when taken orally.[[2]](#ref2)[[4]](#ref4)


#### 2.2Serum


Chondroitin can be found circulating in subjects with no reported exposure to supplementation at a concentration ranging from 0.3µg/mL[[5]](#ref5) up to 20.8µg/mL.[[6]](#ref6)


Supplementation of 1,200mg chondroitin sulfate, alongside glucosamine (hydrochloride), has failed to significantly increase circulating chondroitin concentrations either acutely or after three months of supplementation.[[6]](#ref6) This study did note that subjects had a baseline value of 20.8µg/mL chondroitin in one study arm[[6]](#ref6) and other studies which note lower baseline levels (0.3µg/mL) observed that 4,000mg chondroitin can increase circulating levels up to 5.3µg/mL after 2-6 hours.[[5]](#ref5)


#### 2.3Elimination


Chondroitin appears to be eliminated primarily through the urine.[[7]](#ref7)

### 4Effects in practice

Various studies have noted benefit with combined treatment of [Glucosamine](/supplements/glucosamine/) and Chondroitin.[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9)[[10]](#ref10)


That being said, most recent meta-analyses indicate that the benefits gained from the combination or Chondroitin in isolation are not significantly different from placebo, and causation for improvement cannot be placed on the compounds themselves.[[11]](#ref11)[[12]](#ref12)[[13]](#ref13) It is mentioned that most studies finding benefit separate from placebo either have poor study design or inadequate sample sizes, whereas larger scale studies note no difference.[[11]](#ref11)[[13]](#ref13)


In effect, the scientific consensus of chondroitin at this time is one of uncertainty as it does not appear to be much different when compared to placebo.
