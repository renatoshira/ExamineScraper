### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Paederia foetida* (family of *Rubiaceae*) is a plant from the Central and Eastern Himilayas growing at elevations of 5000m or above, and is called *Prasarini* in Hindi,[[1]](#ref1)Â *Gandhali*,[[2]](#ref2) and *Akar Sekuntut* in Malaysia.[[3]](#ref3) It has some recorded usage for rheumatoid arthritis and for difficult labors as well as being an [aphrodisiac](/supplements/aphrodisiac/), producing a youthful glow, and to enhance seminal parameters.


It is considered highly aromatic and is sometimes eaten as a culinary dish, either raw or steamed.[[3]](#ref3)


#### 1.2Composition


* Paederine, Paederone, Paederolone, and Paederenine[[3]](#ref3)
* Hentriacontane[[1]](#ref1)
* Hentriacontanol[[1]](#ref1)
* Irioid Glycosides[[4]](#ref4)
* Ceryl alcohol[[1]](#ref1)
* Methylemercaptan[[1]](#ref1)
* Palmitic Acid (dietary fatty acid)[[1]](#ref1)
* [Ursolic Acid](/supplements/ursolic-acid/)[[1]](#ref1)
* Stigmasterol, Campesterol, and Sitosterol[[1]](#ref1)

Over 77 components in the volatile oils have been noted.[[5]](#ref5)


The phenolic content of fresh leaves can reach 62.64+/-1.32 while raw stems can reach 60.93+/-3.40 (mg/g ferulic acid equivalents); both of which decline upon drying.[[3]](#ref3)

### 2Neurology

#### 2.1Aphrodisia


In sexually mature rats given 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of *Paederia foetida*, aphrodisia was confirmed by an increase in mounting frequency (231%) and decrease in mounting latency (31.2%) paired with an increase in intromission frequency (222%) and decrease in intromission latency (21%); all effects were both dose and time dependent, with the peak values (given) being reached with 200mg/kg after 28 days.[[1]](#ref1) The aphrodisiac effects (highest dose at 28 days) were comparable to the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone (injections) biweekly.[[1]](#ref1)

### 3Interactions with Hormones

#### 3.1Testosterone


An increase in serum testosterone has been noted in otherwise healthy rats given 100-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract (not 50mg/kg) for 28 days, both of the higher doses appearing to fluctuate in the 4-4.5ng/mL range (value derived from chart) with control slightly below 2ng/L; barely significant increases in testosterone were noted at day 15 in the highest dose group only.[[1]](#ref1)

### 4Inflammation and Immunology

#### 4.1Mechanisms


*Paederia foetida* appears to have some anti-inflammatory effects as assessed by a granuloma formation test in mice, where injections of 100-200mg/kg *Paederua foetida* outperformed the active control (100mg/kg phenylbutazone).[[6]](#ref6)

### 5Interactions with Oxidation

#### 5.1Mechanisms


The fresh leaves of *Paederia foetida* have been shown to have antioxidative potential *in vitro* with a potency greater than that of [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/) but less than that of [Vitamin E](/supplements/vitamin-e/) in a beta-carotene oxidation test.[[3]](#ref3) Similar trends have been noted in an ABTS free radical test, with the leaves outperforming Quercetin but not surpassing [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c/) as active control.[[3]](#ref3)

### 6Interactions with Organs

#### 6.1Penis


A study conducted on male rats using 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract for 28 days noted an increase in the penile erection index (PEI) with 100-200mg/kg at day 15 (175%, no dose dependence) and all doses at day 28 (154-289%); both of which outperformed the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone biweekly.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 6.2Testes


28 days supplementation of 50-200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of *Paederia foetida* was able to increase the weight of the testes (5.9%), epididymus (9.3%) and seminal vesicles (7.9%) with no apparent dose-dependence.[[1]](#ref1) Upon histological examination, a slight vasodilatory effect and increased spermatid concentrations were noted in the testes and the Sertoli cells were enlarged and highly processed.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 6.3Prostate


The one rat study using 50-200mg/kg of an ethanolic extract of *Paederia foetida* for 28 days noted that while there was a trend to increase prostate weight that this increase failed to reach statistical significance; the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone biweekly also failed to reach statistical significance.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 6.4Intestines


In a castor-oil induced diarrhea test, 100-500mg/kg of the ethanolic extract of *Paederia foetida* was able to exert an acute anti-diarrhea effect with 500mg/kg only having significance up to 6 hours.[[7]](#ref7) Anti-diarrheal effects were also noted in a [Magnesium](/supplements/magnesium/) sulfate test, and tended to decrease intestinal motility induced by Barium Sulphate and Cisplatin.[[7]](#ref7)
