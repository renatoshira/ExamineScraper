The below are the compounds found in Pomegranate fruits. For science on the health benefits of Pomegrantes, refer to the [Punicalagins](/supplements/punicalagins/) page for the juice (water-soluble components) and the [Punicic Acid](/supplements/punicic-acid/) page for Pomegranate Oil (fat-soluble components). For eating the fruit itself, a combination of the two pages would give a good overall notion, but the Punicalagins page is probably more similar to the fruit itself:


* The anti-oxidant [Punicalagin](/supplements/punicalagins/) molecules, as well as the two molecules that make up Punicalagins (Ellagic acid and Gallic acid). Tannins (catechin chains) are also present and contribute to anti-oxidant purposes[[1]](#ref1)
* [Punicic Acid](/supplements/punicic-acid/)[[2]](#ref2) at around 63.5% of total fatty acids in pomegranate (confirmed) and perhaps an additional 14.2% of Punicic Acid isomers[[3]](#ref3) which could be alpha-eleostearic acid as they have been isolated in Pomegranates before[[4]](#ref4)
* Trace amounts of the fatty acids oleic, stearic, linoleic and palmitic acids.[[3]](#ref3)
* Small amounts of the pro-estrogenic compounds Coumestrol and Estrone[[5]](#ref5) which *might* be bioactive.[[6]](#ref6)
* Small amounts (0.015% of oil extract) of flavonoids[[3]](#ref3) that are not Punicalagins or related molecules
* Water-soluble proteins found in the seeds (bioactivity unknown)[[7]](#ref7)
* Î²-sitosterol[[8]](#ref8)

When using Pomegranate Seed Oil (Shorthanded to PSO), the content of [Punicalagins](/supplements/punicalagins/) are decreased while the concentration of [Punicic Acid](/supplements/punicic-acid/) and other fatty acids is increased; sometimes up to 72% (some studies on Punicic Acid used PSO at this concentration)
