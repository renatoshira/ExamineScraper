Sources and Structure

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a peptide hormone and neurotransmitter most known for its regulation of sleep, where darkness causes increased synthesis and secretion of melatonin induces sedation and initiate the sleep cycle. Due to its structure, it is also classified as an indoleamine.

Melatonin is also found in a variety of foods, and is universally found in plants, although possibly in minute, bioactive quantities.[1] Good sources of melatonin that are commonly consumed include:[2][3]

Tomato at 3–114 ng/g[4][5]Walnuts at 3-4ng/g[6]Cereal (barley, rye) at 300–1,000 pg/g[1]Strawberries at 1–11 ng/g[4]Olive oil at 53–119 pg/ml[7]Unprocessed cow milk at 3–25 pg/ml[8][9]Night-time milk (functional food product) at 10–40 ng/ml[10]Wine (from grapes) at 50–230 pg/ml[4][11]Beer (from hops) at 52–170 pg/ml[12]Cherries at 2.06-13.46ng/g[13]Common supplements (or herbs not commonly used as food products) that contain melatonin are (64 total, not all listed):

Periostracum cicadae (Chantui) at 3.7mcg/g[14]Babreum coscluea (Shiya Tea-Leaf), Uncaria rhynchophylla (Gouteng), and Viola philippica Cav (Diding) at 2.1-2.3mcg/g[14]Phellodendron amurense (Huangbo) at 1.235mcg/g and Mori Albae Cortex (Sangbaipi) at 1.11mcg/g[14]Coptis chinensis (Huanglian) at 1mcg/g[14]Angelica sinsensis (Danghui) at 698ng/g[14]Ziziphus jujuba (Suanzhaoren) at 256ng/g, or 146ng/g in the variant referred to as Dazao[14]Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) at 187ng/g[14]Panax notoginseng (Sangqui) at 169ng/g[14]Curcuma aeruginosa (Erzhu) at 120ng/g[14]Schisandra Chinensis (Wuweizi) fruits at 86ng/g[14]
Melatonin is produced naturally in the body, and is also a functional food component, similar to its amino acid precursor L-tryptophan, and some intermediate metabolites like serotonin, which is found in some foods.


1.2

Biological Significance

Melatonin is made de novo in the human body in multiple locations, with the pineal gland in the brain being the most well known. Other locations include bone marrow cells,[15] the retina,[16] and the gastrointestinal tract.[17]

The biosynthetic pathway of melatonin starts from the dietary amino acid L-tryptophan, which is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP, by tryptophan-5-hydroxylase. 5-HTP is converted to the active hormone serotonin by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, further converted to N-acetylserotonin by the enzyme serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (sometimes called arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase), and finally converted to N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) by the enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT).[18] Increases in melatonin from supplemental L-tryptophan have been noted in non-human species to varying degrees.[19] Sometimes, melatonin failed to increase.[20] This may be due to the first rate limiting enzyme tryptophan-5-hydroxylase (regulating conversion of dietary tryptophan to serotonin). Thus, supplementing melatonin appears to circumvent this rate limit. The 'true' rate-limiting enzyme is arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase, which mediates conversion from serotonin to N-acetylserotonin[21] and is the control point for external regulation by light and darkness, being suppressed with light-induced signals from the retina.[22]


Melatonin is made from serotonin, which is made from dietary L-tryptophan. It is regulated by sunlight, mostly in the retina.


Given how the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the pituitary expresses melatonin receptors,[23] it is thought that supplemental melatonin can suppress endogenous secretion via negative feedback.

Oral melatonin supplementation at 500mcg, over a period of a week in shift workers, did not influence basal secretion, as cessation for one day prior to measurements did not show differences when compared to secretion status prior to supplementation.[24] Twenty-four hour melatonin levels in this study, when graphed, essentially overlapped, suggesting next to no variance.[24] These results, indicating a lack of negative feedback, have been replicated with 2mg[25] and 5mg of melatonin.[26]

When a blind person supplemented a dose of 50mg in one case study (blind people being an example of a population with no sunlight-mediated melatonin production), this dose being 100-fold higher than the standard 500mcg, did not significantly influence basal secretion status.[24] In this population, lower doses of 500mcg are also effective and without apparent negative feedback.[27]

Results in blind people suggest that an override of regulation from sunlight/darkness may not be the factor behind the lack of negative feedback, as some studies do control for persons with no conscious light perception.[27]


Regulation of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland does not appear to be negatively influenced by melatonin supplementation over the long term (multiple days) and no negative feedback from melatonin supplementation (less natural secretion after a period of supplementation) has been observed.


Beyond just fluctuating throughout every day (higher in evening, lower during waking hours), melatonin may fluctuate throughout the seasons in humans, following a bimodal distribution with peaks in January and July.[28]


Some alterations of circulating melatonin level depend on the season. Clinical relevance is currently unknown.


The circadian rhythm of melatonin appears to shift toward earlier clock hours later on in the aging process.[29]

When investigating rats divided into three age groups (correlating with youth, adult, and elderly), it appears that overall melatonin levels are highest in adults (only due to youth having smaller pineal glands; youth has the highest density of melatonin) and lower levels of melatonin are apparent in elderly rats.[30] Similar trends were seen in N-acetylserotonin, another pineal hormone.[30] This higher density in rat pups is seen in human youth, where spikes in melatonin occur around age 2-4 and then decline until puberty, where they remain constant, [31] before gradually declining over the rest of the lifespan. The most drastic drop in nightly melatonin levels appears to occur around the ages of 41-60, where the melatonin levels of 41-50 year-olds is significantly higher than the age bracket of 51-60.[31][32][33][34][35]


Melatonin appears to fluctuate with age, decreasing steadily after puberty, but undergoing a significant decrease in average nightly melatonin levels around the ages of 41-60.


Melatonin levels appear to correlate with one's dietary lifestyle.[2] Consumption of plant-based products may influence circulating melatonin levels due to plants containing melatonin in possibly physiologically relevant levels, if a sufficient amount of the plant is consumed.[3] At least in survey research, the highest quartile of vegetable intake (relative to the lowest quartile) is associated with a 16% higher urinary melatonin level.[36]

Studies on fasting people (or food restriction to less than 300 calories daily) note that circulating melatonin levels can decrease by up to 20%, with no change of urinary secretion rates over a period of 2-7 days.[37][38][39] This may be secondary to transient glucose deprivation, as supplementation with glucose at 0.5g/kg during these periods restores circulating levels of melatonin, and suggests that the pinealocytes that secrete melatonin may require glucose for optimal functioning.[39][38] However, when investigating rats undergoing caloric restriction (40% of basal metabolic rate) for the purposes of longevity, melatonin levels in serum are increased.[40]


Melatonin levels appear to fluctuate with overall caloric and food intake, as well as some food selections. Melatonin may be relevant for explaining some of the health benefits of vegetables, and this could potentially extend to alcohol-containing products.


In people with major depressive disorder, serum melatonin disorders appeared to be lower than age-matched controls, with no difference in this sample during depressive episodes and during periods of remission.[41]

In people with bipolar disorder, serum melatonin disorders appeared to be lower than age-matched controls.[41]


Some alterations in circulating melatonin levels depend on clinical states, like depression or bipolar disorder.


When comparing active smokers of tobacco against non-smoking controls, smokers appear to have approximately twice the circulating levels of melatonin when measured during the daytime (11-12h): 17.44+/-1.8 pg/ml in smokers relative to 9.77+/-1.4 pg/ml in non-smokers,[42] while a study on 21 young female smokers taking measurements of serum melatonin at night (23-24h) found that, relative to non-smokers, smokers had reduced levels of melatonin (47.9+/-14.5pg/mL) and nonsmokers 47% higher levels (70.5+/-18.9pg/mL).[43] A later study on smokers found endogenous levels of melatonin in smokers just above 2nmol/L/h, which is not significantly different from the nonsmokers in the previous study.[44] This latter study did note, however, that smokers were about half as responsive to blood increases in melatonin from supplements,[44] due to induction of the aromatase enzyme from Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in cigarette smoke.[42][45]


Alterations in melatonin status and smoking are complex and understudied. There may be a normalization of the circadian rhythm, which needs to be confirmed with further studies. Smokers appear to have less response to melatonin supplementation than do nonsmokers.


1.3

Formulations and Variants

Epithalamin is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland (similar to melatonin) that has been implicated in prolonging lifespan in Drosophilia, certain strains of mice, and rats. No influence was found in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) mice.[46][47] For those that saw an improvement in lifespan, the values ranged from 10-35%, with rats experiencing a 57% reduction in mortality. In these tested animals, epithalamin administration increased melatonin secretion.[46]

One study administering epithalamin (6 courses of treatment of 10mg every third day for 15 days, spanning 3 years) to people aged 60-69 with aged cardiovascular systems and low serum melatonin noted that, 12 years after cessation of epithalamin treatment and during follow-up, some parameters associated with aging appeared to be either attenuated or reversed. The epithalamin group outperformed placebo on cycling power, improved lipid and glucose metabolism, and appeared to normalize the suppressed nightly spike of melatonin in the aged control.[48]


Epithalamin is a peptide hormone related to melatonin that seems to be able to prolong lifespan in research animals, and improve biomarkers in elderly humans.

Molecular Targets

2.1

Melatonin Receptors

Melatonin exerts many of its effects vicariously through melatonin receptors, similar to how insulin affects the insulin receptor. The melatonin receptors are named MT1 and MT2, and are G-protein coupled receptors (GPRCs) coupled to Gi proteins (a heterotrimer of α, β, and γ that dissociates into α and βγ when the receptor is activated[49]).[50] These two receptors are quite different from each other, as they structure[51][52] pharmacological characteristics[53] and chromosomal location,[54] yet both have high affinity for melatonin.[55][56] A third 'receptor' exists, known as MT3, but it is not a GPRC like MT1/2. Due to the cytoplasmic protein quinone reductase II having the same melatonin binding properties as 'MT3',[57] and deletion of quinone reductase II causing 'MT3' to disappear, MT3 may just be quinone reductase II.[58][59]


Two G-protein coupled receptors, with different actions, mediate the actions of melatonin, MT1 and MT2. Quinone reductase II may bind to melatonin and was thought to be a third receptor (MT3), but it is a cytoplasmic protein. Quinone reductase II may still be relevant, however.


An orphan receptor on the nuclear membrane, named RZR/ROR, can mediate melatonin-like effects.[60][61]


A fourth receptor, located on the nucleus rather than the cytoplasm, appears to be intimately involved with nuclear melatonin signalling via cytoplasmic receptor cross-talk.


Expression of melatonin receptors are in[50] the Suprachiasmatic Nuclei (SCN) of the Pineal gland, where MT1 and MT2 both exist and MT1 activation suppresses neuronal firing, the hypothalamus, where both receptors suppress gonadotropin releasing hormone release, the retina, where MT2 reduces dopamine release and an MT3 receptor reduces ocular pressure, the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland,[62] the kidneys (MT1),[63] the pancreas and beta-cells of the pancreas (both MT1 and MT2),[64] the adrenal cortex, where MT1 activation suppresses cortisol secretion, the testes, where MT1 suppresses testosterone, the pituitary, where MT1 suppresses Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and prolactin. Expression of melatonin receptors is also present in vasculature, where each main receptor mediates either vasoconstriction (MT1) or vasodilation (MT2) and on some adipocytes where MT1 negatively regulates adipose tissue proliferation and increases leptin secretion (there is no MT2 on white adipose tissue, but there is expression of MT2 on brown adipose suppresses glucose uptake[65]).


Melatonin is most heavily localized in the brain and associated neuro-organs. It also has a heavy presence in sex organs. It is a fairly ubiquitous compound, with expression on fat cells, immune cells, cardiac cells as well as the bloodstream cells


2.2

Non-melatonin receptors

GPR50 is an orphan receptor (belonging to the same GPRC family as melatonin receptors[66]), which appears to play a role in adaptive thermogenesis[67] and is expressed in humans, specifically in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and tanycytes that line the third ventricle.[68] Knockout of this receptor (abolishing its effects) appears to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity, yet paradoxically reduces the amount of weight lost in a fasted state. Knockout also reduced night time thermogenesis, despite 25% higher locomotion during waking hours.[69] GPR50 appears to interact with leptin signalling, as administration of leptin can improve GPR50 nuclear activity in obese mice (with seemingly suppressed levels of GPR50[67]) but not in GPR50-/- mice, suggesting leptin acts vicariously through this receptor, but only on matters related to thermogenesis (as feeding patterns appear unaltered).[67][70] In fact, after leptin was administered to rats with the standard leptin receptor but no GPR50 receptor, the amount of genes activated by leptin in control mice (2,705) is reduced by just over 50% (to 1,327).[67] It should be noted that melatonin is not a direct ligand of this receptor.[71][66]


GPR50 is an orphan receptor, which seems to mediate the aspects of leptin related to thermogenesis, but not appetite. It may mediate up to half of the effects of leptin as well.


GPR50 appears to heterodimerize with the melatonin receptor MT1, which results in reduced efficacy of MT1 signalling, by preventing the binding of agonists to MT1.[72] GPR50 has the capacity to heterodimerize with MT2, but does not influence the functions of MT2, similar to how MT1 and MT2 heterodimerization does not influence binding of ligands.[72] Melatonin normally has a Ki of 0.73±0.26nM, yet the heterodimerization has a Ki of 0.37±0.28nM.[72] Secondary to this, GPR50 appears to antagonize the effects of MT1.[72] Co-expression of GPR50 alongside MT1 does not affect basal MT1 actions, but reduces the maximal response of MT1 by melatonin agonism by 50%. Reducing the expression of GPR50 reverses these effects.[72]


Expression of GPR50 appears to reduce the actions of MT1, and may alter the signals sent through MT1 via melatonin.

Pharmacology

3.1

Transportation in Serum

In a model of delayed sleep phase syndrome, 500mcg of melatonin appears to be as effective as ten-fold the dose (5mg).[73] A comparative study between 300mcg and 3mg in age-related insomnia noted that 300mcg was more effective than 3mg.[74]

A comparative study between 500mcg and forty-fold the dose (20mg) showed that 500mcg was more effective at regulating the circadian rhythm of a blind person (with no external melatonin regulation from darkness).[75] A lower dose of 10mg in blind people appears to be more effective than 20mg, although insignificantly different from 500mcg.[76]


Although differences between very low (300-500mcg) and higher (3-5mg) doses tend to go back and forth in regard to efficacy, both seem to be more potent than superloaded doses (20mg).


Oral doses of 500mcg melatonin (seen as the lowest active dose) in shift workers resulted in a Cmax of 1,580+/-329 pg/ml after a Tmax of 1+/-0.14 hours,[24] noting that this high dose was above physiological ranges for up to three hours, but after the fourth hour levels returned to the physiological range of 24-198pg/mL.[24] Other studies that use 500mcg note serum levels of 3,054+/-3,022pmol/L (709.4+/-701.9pg/mL) with a half-life of 0.68 hours.[77]

Studies that use 5mg of melatonin note that serum spikes of 1,638.0+/-61.9pg/mL are seen at 30 minutes,[78] 23,982pmol/L (5,570.67pg/mL) with a half-life of 0.79 hours.[77]

With 6mg of melatonin, in one hour serum levels of 1,171.3+/-235.2pg/mL are seen.[79]

One study assessing 100mg melatonin (200-fold higher dose than the lowest active dose) noted serum peaks approximately 100 minutes after administration, or 652,310+/-82,456pmol/L (151,517+/-19,153pg/mL).[80] This dose is able to stay in circulation longer than smaller doses, still affecting biology up to bedtime, when taken at 8am.[80][81] The study noting the higher serum peak measured levels of 95+/-15pmol/L (22.06+/-3.48pg/mL) the next morning at 8am, which was still above baseline for these participants.[80]


Serum peaks are quite unreliable, although all small doses tend to increase circulating melatonin around 8-10 times more than the highest physiologically relevant concentration. Higher doses increase melatonin levels even further, and delay the time to peak concentrations while also delaying the excretion rates.


When examining a large dose (80mg) of melatonin given to healthy people in the morning (7:30am), the various parameters recorded were: a 24m half-life, with stable levels 60-150 minutes after ingestion and a gradual decline in serum melatonin levels until 9pm, when they returned to physiologically relevant levels.[82] The peak values were highly variable and significant in magnitude, 350-10,000fold higher than previously observed peak levels. Such variability has been seen elsewhere[83]), and hourly dosing of 80mg melatonin was able to attenuate but unable to inhibit the decline throughout the day.[82]

Fast absorption appears to be similar between higher doses (80mg),[82] 100mg[84]) and lower doses (6mg).[83] One study testing four low doses (100mcg, 500mcg, 1mg, 5mg) also noted that the absorption rates appeared to be nonsignificantly different, all taking within 0.78-1.25 hours to reach Cmax.[77]


Melatonin appears to be rapidly absorbed and very rapidly excreted, with the concentration in the blood between these times being significantly higher than normal levels.


When administered intranasally to rabbits, melatonin had a bioavailability of 94% when paired with sodium glycocholate, but 55% without.[85] This route of administration was accompanied by a 5 minute Tmax and a 13 minute half-life, with 1.5mg of melatonin conferring a Cmax of 493+/-290ng/mL at 5 minutes. These parameters mimicked intravenous injections.[85]


Melatonin administered via the nasal route may be markedly more effective than oral supplementation.


3.2

Metabolism

At the stage of 6-hydroxylation of melatonin into its main urinary metabolite (6-hydroxymelatonin), aromatase (CYP1A1/2) appears to be very important, with some metabolism by CYP1B1 and CYP2C19.[86][87][88] Metabolism of melatonin by CYP1B1 appears to be of greater relevance to central (neural) melatonin, due to it not being expressed much in the liver.[89] Due to metabolism by aromatase, co-ingestion of aromatase inhibitors (in this case, fluvoxamine) can increase melatonin AUC and overall exposure.[90][91] Habits that induce aromatase (such as tobacco smoking) appear to be correlated to reduced circulating melatonin.[44]

4.

Neurology

4.1

Adrenergic Neurotransmission

In humans, 3mg of melatonin is able to attenuate a stress-induced rise in adrenaline and noradrenaline in young healthy men, but is unable to abolish it.[92] Without a stressor, oral melatonin at low doses (1-2mg) appears to reduce circulating adrenaline by about 60-90 minutes after ingestion.[93][94][95]


Melatonin may be able to reduce concentrations of circulating adrenaline and noradrenaline.


4.2

Dopaminergic Neurotransmission

Melatonin appears to inhibit dopamine release in the ventral hippocampus, medulla pons, preoptic area, and the hypothalamus (posterior and median),[96][97] yet no inhibition occurs in the cerebral cortex, striatum, cerebellum, or dorsal hippocampus.[97] This inhibition appears to be mediated by inhibiting calcium influx into co-stimulated nerves.[98][99] In accordance to this inhibition, active in physiologically relevant nM ranges (although maximal potency is at pharmacological mM ranges), dopamine experiences a diurnal rhythm of release, vicariously through melatonin suppression.[100][101] This inhibition of dopamine release appears to apply to amphetamine-induced dopamine release, which may be of concern to ephedrine supplementation.[102][103]


Mechanistically, melatonin appears to be a negative regulator of dopamine release in neurons.


4.3

Miscellaneous Mechanisms

Melatonin works through the MT1 receptor on the Suprachiasmatic Nuclei (SCN) to inhibit cAMP element response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, secondary to pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP)[104][105] and through the MT2 receptors of the SCN to facilitate changing of the circadian rhythm, a phenomena known as phase shifting. This appears to be mediated via protein kinase C (PKC).[106] It is mostly through MT2, but to a lesser extent MT1, that melatonin acts to regulate sleep-wake cycles.[107][108] MT2 works to regulate the phase shifts,[106][109][110] while MT1 exerts general suppressive actions on cell activation.[111][112]

A 500mcg dose of melatonin appears to be able to increase secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin within 40-60 minutes of oral ingestion. However, 5mg has no significant influence on its own, yet it is able to suppress an increase in vasopressin normally seen with exercise.[113] Another study using 50mcg as well as 500mcg and 5mg noted that, in roughly the same population, 50mcg was not significantly different than placebo in regards to vasopressin and barely more significant in increasing oxytocin, while 500mcg significantly increased both neurohormones by 40 minutes after dosing, levels of which appeared to normalize by 150 minutes. A 5mg dose showed a suppressive effect once again.[114] This suppression was noted in a third study using 5mg nightly for 4 days.[115]

4.4

Neurooxidation

Melatonin is implicated in neuroprotection as an antioxidant compound and as a protector against the harmful effects of beta-amyloid pigmentation, by reducing levels of said pigmentation and by offering protection from downstream effects.[116] Melatonin also seems to have preventive effects on hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, which is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.[116]

Melatonin may also confer neuroprotection via mediating the Akt/mTOR pathway, as it can induce the pathway in times of ischemia-reperfusion injury (when it should be suppressed),[117] methamphetamine induced suppression of mTOR,[118] and suppresses overexpression of this and the MAPK pathways via H202 stimulation.[119]

Melatonin shows synergism with Resveratrol in regards to protection against beta-amyloid pigmentation in regards to AMPK phosphorylation and its downstream effects; although its effects on the glycogen synthase enzyme expression (GSK-1) and glutathione depletion (both risk factors neuropathy) were not synergistic in vitro.[120]

4.5

Headaches and Blood Flow

Melatonin has been investigated for its usage in treating migraines[121], due to migraines having a circadian rhythm[122] and insomnia being correlated with morning migraines.[123] One study that tested this hyp
