### 2Neurology

Palmatine has been shown to enhance the efficacy of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in neurons, by increasing the output of neurite from PC12 neurons exposed to an NGF stimuli.[[1]](#ref1) These effects were also seen with Berberine and coptisine, with berberine being more effective than coptisine being more effective than palmatine. Protoberberine compounds also suppress catecholamine synthesis in neurons[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3) with palmatine having a lower IC50 value. These suppressive effects are more potent with palmatine, and at least in regards to dopamine are not seen with coptisine.[[4]](#ref4) These effects were seen through direction inhibition of the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme.
