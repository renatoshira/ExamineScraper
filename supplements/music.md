### 1Music and Dopamine

Music has the ability to release dopamine. The effect of this seems to be via a calmodulin-dependent system.[[1]](#ref1)Â 


Dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens occurs during peak emotional arousal (the best part) and from caudate (another brain organ) during periods of *anticipation* for the peak emotional arousal.[[2]](#ref2)

### 2Effects on Blood Pressure

Via a calcium/calmodulin-dependent dopamine-synthesizing system, dopamine can potentially reduce blood pressure.[[3]](#ref3) Via this mechanism, music has been shown to reduce blood pressure (albeit in lab animals) and has more potency at higher frequencies (albeit still being calming music).[[4]](#ref4) This effect may be only applicable to those with higher blood pressure in the first place (and hopefully not only rats).[[5]](#ref5)

### 4Music and Exercise

Music administered during exercise has the ability to increase time to exhaustion during aerobic exercise while reducing blood pressure and heart rate, hypothesized to be via relaxation mechanisms.[[9]](#ref9) Differences in adrenaline between the two groups were noted. These changes in adrenaline stop upon cessation of music, are dependent on the tempo of the music, and do not seem to be causative of the changes in performance during exercise to a significant degree.[[10]](#ref10)


Listening to motivational music (music that encourages motion and activity) encourages enhanced blood lactate clearance possibly via unintentional additional movement.[[11]](#ref11)</di|authors=Eliakim M, Bodner E, Eliakim A, Nemet D, Meckel Y|journal=J Strength Cond Res]

### 5Music and Addiction

Music appears to have the potential to augment already addictive behaviors via association. This result can be either positive or detrimental depending on context.[[12]](#ref12)[[13]](#ref13)
