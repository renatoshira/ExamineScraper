### 1Sources and Composition

*Euonymus alatus* (Gui Jeon Wu) is a plant of which its stems have been used traditionally for cancer treatment.[[1]](#ref1) And has also been used for blood circulation and eliminating blood clots, reducing pain, and treating dysmenorrhea in Asian medicine.[[2]](#ref2)


#### 1.1Composition


The bioactives that are fairly unique to *Euonymus Alatus* include:


* Three glycosides of Cardenolide where the 3-carbon is attached by Rhamnose (To give *Acovenosigenin A 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside*), Rhamnose attached to a Glucose (the diglycoside known as *Euonymoside A*), and then a triglycoside of Rhamnose with two glucose sugars in a chain (*Euonymusoside A*)[[3]](#ref3)
* 2-{1-(Hydroxy methyl)-4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-phenyl}-propan-1,3-diol (1.8% ethanol extract), 5R,6S-6,9,10-trihydroxy-megastigma-7-en-3-one (2.25% ethanolic extract) and 2-{4-(3-Hydroxy-propenyl)-3,5-dimethoxy-phenyl}-propane-1,3-diol;[[4]](#ref4)

With more common bioactives (found in many herbs) being:


* 5-caffeoylquinic acid ([Chlorogenic Acid](/supplements/chlorogenic-acid/)) from the stems[[5]](#ref5)[[5]](#ref5) at 4.5% of an 80% ethanolic extract;[[4]](#ref4) also the metabolite 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (caffeic acid)[[6]](#ref6)
* Lignan compounds including (+)-syringaresinol and De-4′-methylyangabin[[7]](#ref7)
* Sesquilignans Hedyotol C and threo-buddlenol B[[7]](#ref7)
* Dilignans Hedyotisol C and Hedyotisol B[[7]](#ref7)
* Neolignans such as (−)- and (+)- simulanol, (-)- and (+)-dihydrodehyrodiconiferyl alcohol, and guaiacylglycerol-8-O-4′-(coniferyl alcohol) ether (both 7R,8S and 7S,8R configurations)[[7]](#ref7)
* Grasshopper ketone (2.55% methanolic extract)[[4]](#ref4)
* Syringin (2.65% methanolic extract)[[4]](#ref4)
* (+)-usnic acid and benzoic acids[[8]](#ref8)
* [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/) at 0.011-0.016mg/g (50% ethanolic extract),[[9]](#ref9) Quercetin-3-O-D-galactopyronoside at 5.5% ethanolic extract,[[4]](#ref4) and Rutin at 0.265-0.275mg/g of the 50% ethanolic extract (seems to be best to concentrate Quercetin structures from *E.Alatus*).[[9]](#ref9) The related Quercetin structures Hyperoside and Quercitrin have also been isolated from this plant, as well as Quercetin 3,7-dirhamnoside[[10]](#ref10)
* [Kaempferol](/supplements/kaempferol/)[[11]](#ref11) and its 3,7-dirhamnoside *Kaempferitrin*[[10]](#ref10)
* [Apigenin](/supplements/apigenin/)-3-O-L-rhamnopyranoside[[4]](#ref4)
* Catechin, dehydrodicatechin A, and catechin lactone A[[10]](#ref10)
* Daucosterol[[8]](#ref8)
* Symplocoside[[10]](#ref10)
* Taxifolin[[4]](#ref4)
* Naringenin[[4]](#ref4)
* Aromadendrin,[[4]](#ref4) which may fluctuate wildly[[12]](#ref12)

The total flavonoid content of Euonymus Alatus is 235.7mg/kg fresh weight.[[13]](#ref13)

### 2Pharmacology

#### 2.1Enzymatic Interactions


*Euonymus Alatus* extract appears to be effective in inhibiting the aromatase enzyme in myometrial and leiomyomal cells (uterus related).[[14]](#ref14) Whether it affects other aromatase enzymes is not known, but if it does it may increase circulating testosterone levels.

### 3Interactions with Fat Mass

#### 3.1Mechanism


Some flavonoid compounds from Euonymus Alatus appear to prevent triglyceride accumulation into differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with most potency at 25uM concentration coming from quercetin 3,7-dirhamnoside (79.1% of control; set at 100%), hyperoside (71.3%), kaempferitrin (62.3%), catechin lactone A (79.9%) and dehydrodicatechin A (70.2%);[[10]](#ref10) hyperoside has been reported with this inhibitory potency previously[[15]](#ref15) but may not be the consensus due to differing data elsewhere.[[16]](#ref16)[[17]](#ref17) The potency of these compounds is comparable to 25uM of [resveratrol](/supplements/resveratrol/), with kaempferitrin trending to be more potent.[[10]](#ref10)


Both [Kaempferol](/supplements/kaempferol/) and [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/) in *Euonymus Alatus* appear to be able to bind to the PPARγ receptor too weakly to induce adipocyte proliferation, and may block the pro-adipogenic effects of PPARγ agonists such as Rosiglitazone due to higher affinity (thus acting as receptor modulators).[[11]](#ref11) Despite these mechanisms, both appear to enhance glucose uptake into adipocytes.[[11]](#ref11)

### 4Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

#### 4.1Absorption


*Euonymus alatus* methanolic extract has inhibitory potential on the α-glucosidase enzyme with an IC50 value of 272µg/mL (in a yeast assay),[[18]](#ref18) and of 8 compounds purified from the plant for interactions with the α-glucosidase noted that 6 compounds had more efficacy than the active control Arcabose (IC50 679.7µM) including catechin (119.1µM), quercetin 3,7-dirhamnoside (39.6µM), hyperoside (31.6µM), kaempferitrin (23.0µM), catechin lactone A (71.8µM) and dehydrodicatechin A (102.5µM).[[10]](#ref10) Another compound (quercitrin) was found inactive on this assay[[10]](#ref10) but has been noted elsewhere to have an IC50 of 38.4 µM.[[19]](#ref19)



> Components have inhibitory potential on alpha-glucosidase, a carbohydrate digestive enzyme


When 500mg/kg of *Euonymus Alatus* (methanolic extract) is given to rats alongside a 1g/kg bolus of starch and having blood measured for the next 4 hours, supplementation was able to reduce the subsequent AUC of glucose by 25.5% relative to starch control;[[18]](#ref18) fecal analysis was not performed.



> Inhibition of starch absorption has been noted to occur in rats following concomitant ingestion of *Euonymus Alatus* and starch


#### 4.2Mechanisms


17.2mg/kg of an ethyl acetate fraction with a high flavonoid concentration (bioequivalent to 400mg/kg dry weight) is able to, over 7 days, reduce fasting blood glucose slightly in normal mice and more significantly in alloxan-induced diabetic mice; either of equal potency to or lesser than the active control of 140mg/kg Metformin (relatively low dose of Metformin).[[20]](#ref20) Over 4 weeks, this extraction was more effective than 140mg/kg Metformin in reducing fasting blood glucose in Alloxan-induced diabetic mice.[[20]](#ref20) One other study compared Euonymus Alatus (700mg/kg ethanolic extract) against Metformin (250mg/kg) and noted that while both were effective in reducing fasting blood glucose that Metformin was more potent.[[2]](#ref2)

### 5Inflammation and Immunology

#### 5.1Mechanisms


Euonymus Alatus (80% methanolic extract) can inhibit NF-kB activation at 10-30ug/mL with an IC50 of IC50 value of 11.83μg/mL, via inhibiting the IKKβ pathway.[[21]](#ref21) Anti-inflammatory effects in this same *in vitro* model (RAW264.7 macrophage activation via LPS) have been noted to occur with all lignan compounds that were not dilignans[[7]](#ref7) (although flavonoids and isoprenoids may also be active[[4]](#ref4)) and the methanolic extract also appears to inhibit JNK1 (40.6%), JNK2 (28.7%), and JNK3 (32.9%) activation.[[21]](#ref21)



> General anti-inflammatory properties in macrophage stimulation tests


At least one study has noted that, without incubation with LPS or another pro-inflammatory insult, that Euonymus Alatus was able to increase NF-kB activity and inflammatory biomarkers vicariously though recombinant IFNγ.[[22]](#ref22)

### 6Interactions with Oxidation

#### 6.1Oxidation


In cultured rat hepatocytes (liver cells) Euonymus Alatus appears to both exert direct anti-oxidant abilities and enhance anti-oxidant enzymes.[[23]](#ref23)
