### 1Sources and composition

#### 1.1Sources and History


*Rhamnus Nakaharia* (from the family *Rhamnaceae*) is a folk medicine originating in Taiwan that has been used to treat constipation, inï¬‚ammation, malignant tumors, and asthma.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 1.2Composition


*Rhamnus Nakaharai* (RN) is a Taiwanese herbal medicine that contains:


* The napthalenic compound 6-methoxysorigenin and various glycosides and acylates of the parent compound, such as alpha-sorinin[[1]](#ref1) although 6-methoxyorigenin appears to be isolated from the wood component of the herb[[1]](#ref1)
* Isotorachyrsone and derivatives.[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3)
* [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/) glycosides, specifically 3-O-Methylquercetin.[[2]](#ref2)[[4]](#ref4)

### 2Interactions with Oxidation

The compound 6-methoxyorigenin appears to have anti-oxidative effects *in vitro*,[[1]](#ref1) as well as the related compound Isotorachrysone, which share structural similarities.[[3]](#ref3) 6-methoxygenin outperformed Trolox (a research standard) on Metal-chelating and protecting from lipid peroxidation, and was slightly outperformed on a DPPH test.[[1]](#ref1) The IC50 of the metal chelating ability of 6-methoxyorigenin (615.90+/-5.79) was lesser than that of EDTA (127.92+/-6.27).[[1]](#ref1)

### 3Inflammation and Immunology

#### 3.1Mechanisms


3-O-Methylquercetin has been found to suppress the inflammatory (Nitric Oxide mediated) response from LPS (research pro-inflammatory agent) in macrophages *in vitro*.[[4]](#ref4) 3-O-Methylquercetin was found to inhibit Nitric Oxide release, protein expression of iNOS (induced by inflammation) and mRNA translation of iNOS with IC50 values of 4.23uM, 4.36uM, and 6.53uM respectively.[[4]](#ref4)

### 4Intestinal Interactions

#### 4.1Mechanisms


3-O-Methylquercetin appears to be a selective PDE3 inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.6mM via competitive inhibition.[[5]](#ref5)
