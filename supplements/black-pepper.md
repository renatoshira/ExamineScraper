Sources and Pharmacology

Black Pepper (Piper Nigrum) is a common spice and herb used historically for various diseases related to gastrointesinal disorder and dental or oral dysfunction.[1] It is most commonly known in the supplemental realm for its piperine content, but also contains pellitorine, guineensine, pipnoohine, trichostachine, and piperonal.[1]

2.

Enterohepatic Effects

Piperine is known for changing metabolism of various drugs and supplements, most notably increasing curcumin bioavailability by 2000%.[2] It affects metabolism by both intestinal absorption as well as downregulating or inhibiting phase II detoxification enzymes and the glucuronidation process in the liver.[3] It may also contribute to increase absorption by slowing intestinal transit rate and thus prolonging the time said compounds are exposed to the potential uptake.[4]

3.

Gastric and Systemic Effects

Piperine is able to slow both gastric emptying and intestinal transit at doses of 1mg/kg-1.3mg/kg bodyweight.[4] In higher doses, it can induce gastric acid secretion possibly via agonism of gastric histamine H2 receptors.[5]

Safety and toxicity

There exist preliminary evidence that black pepper as a food substance poses carcinogenic effects via some procarcingenic constituents such as safrole and tannins, and some terpene compounds. These procarcinogenic effects were noted with topical application.[6]: Evidence of carcinogenicity]. These effects, however, were not noted with oral ingestion[7] despite rodent hypersensitivity to piperine.[8]

It is generally recognized as safe for human consumption.[9]
