### 1Sources and Pharmacology

Black Pepper (*Piper Nigrum*) is a common spice and herb used historically for various diseases related to gastrointesinal disorder and dental or oral dysfunction.[[1]](#ref1) It is most commonly known in the supplemental realm for its piperine content, but also contains pellitorine, guineensine, pipnoohine, trichostachine, and piperonal.[[1]](#ref1)

### 2Enterohepatic Effects

Piperine is known for changing metabolism of various drugs and supplements, most notably increasing [curcumin](/supplements/curcumin/) bioavailability by 2000%.[[2]](#ref2) It affects metabolism by both intestinal absorption as well as downregulating or inhibiting phase II detoxification enzymes and the glucuronidation process in the liver.[[3]](#ref3) It may also contribute to increase absorption by slowing intestinal transit rate and thus prolonging the time said compounds are exposed to the potential uptake.[[4]](#ref4)

### 3Gastric and Systemic Effects

Piperine is able to slow both gastric emptying and intestinal transit at doses of 1mg/kg-1.3mg/kg bodyweight.[[4]](#ref4) In higher doses, it can induce gastric acid secretion possibly via agonism of gastric histamine H2 receptors.[[5]](#ref5)

### 4Safety and toxicity

There exist preliminary evidence that black pepper as a food substance poses carcinogenic effects via some procarcingenic constituents such as safrole and tannins, and some terpene compounds. These procarcinogenic effects were noted with topical application.[[6]](#ref6): Evidence of carcinogenicity]. These effects, however, were not noted with oral ingestion[[7]](#ref7) despite rodent hypersensitivity to piperine.[[8]](#ref8)


It is generally recognized as safe for human consumption.[[9]](#ref9)
