### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Caesalpinia benthamiana* (of the *Fabaceae* family and *Caesalpiniaceae* subfamily; synonymous with *Mezoneuron benthamianum*) is an African medicine for erectile dysfunction and libido enhancement[[1]](#ref1) and has been used in the topical treatment of wounds.[[2]](#ref2) The parts of this plant that have been used traditionally include the leaves and the root bark.[[3]](#ref3)



> Has traditional usage as a treatment for male sexual impotence and, when mixed into an oil base, has been used topically to treat wounds and infections


#### 1.2Composition


* Benthaminin A-B (bark)[[2]](#ref2)
* Deoxycaesaldekarin C (aka. *methyl vouacapenate*) in the bark[[2]](#ref2)
* Gallic acid[[1]](#ref1)
* *trans*-[resveratrol](/supplements/resveratrol/)[[1]](#ref1)
* β-sitosterol and stigmastenone[[2]](#ref2)

> Similar to the rest of its genera (*caesalpinia*), this plant appears to contain cassane type diterpenoid structures and has a stilbene (resveratrol) and tannin content. That being said, its composition is pretty much unknown at this time


A water extract has been noted to contain 15.5% polyphenols and 9.9% tannin structures.[[1]](#ref1)

### 2Cardiovascular Health

#### 2.1Blood Flow


In isolated aortic vessels, the water extract appears to cause relaxation of phenylephdrine contracted vessels with and IC50 of 2.7+/-0.3mg/L,[[1]](#ref1) which appears to be related to a concentration dependent increase in eNOS expression in these cells with 0.1-10mg/L of the water extract (79-137.5% increase).[[1]](#ref1)

### 3Inflammation and Immunology

#### 3.1Bacterial Interactions


It appears some of the diterpenoids may have antibacterial properties, with the most potent tested one (Benthaminin A) being effective against *Staphylococcus aureas* and *Micrococcus ﬂavus* (MIC of 47µM) although it was less effective against *Bacillus subtilis* (MIC 95µM) *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (MIC 398µM) and resistant strains of *s. aureus* (MIC 98µM or higher).[[2]](#ref2)

### 4Interactions with Oxidation

#### 4.1Superoxide


The water extract of *caesalpinia benthamiana* appears to directly sequester superoxide (O2-) with an IC50 of 78.1+/-1.2µg/mL (in an acellular system) and, in neutrophils where NADPH oxidase can increase superoxide production, *caesalpinia benthamiana* can sequester O2- with an IC50 of 47.1+/-1.5µg/mL.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 4.2Hydrogen Peroxide


The water extract of *caesalpinia benthamiana* appears to directly sequester hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with an IC50 of 4.7+/-1.0µg/mL (in an acellular system) and, in a cellular system, can sequester H2O2 with an IC50 of 6.0+/-1.0µg/mL.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 4.3Hypochlorous Acid


The water extract of *caesalpinia benthamiana* appears to directly sequester hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with an IC50 of 1.5+/-0.1µg/mL (in an acellular system) and, in a cellular system, appears to be weaker with an IC50 of 5.2+/-0.3µg/mL.[[1]](#ref1)



> The direct antiradical properties against hydrochlorous acid appear to be quite respectable *in vitro*

### 5Sexuality and Pregnancy

#### 5.1Libido


When male rats are given 50mg/kg of a water extract of *caesalpinia benthamiana* (2.4% yield) and then placed with nonreceptive females, mounting latency is reduced and frequency increased when measured 15-30 minutes after supplementation (latency reduced to 8% of control, and frequency increased by 276%), 75-90 minutes (down to 1% of control, frequency up 1,916%), and 180-205 minute (again 1% latency of control and frequency up 1,185%).[[1]](#ref1)


When given to male rats placed alongside receptive females, there are increases in intromission frequencey and decreases in latency seen as the 15-30 minutes (latency down to 9% of control; frequency up 85.2%), 75-90 minutes (latency down to 5%; frequency up 95.9%), and 180-205 minutes (latency down to 2% of control; frequency up 228%) after single dosing.[[1]](#ref1)



> The magnitude of libido enhancement seen in these rats greatly exceeds most other [aphrodisiac](/supplements/aphrodisiac/) compounds in the database, and pending a replication of data this could be a very promising application of the plant. The reductions in latency (how long it takes a rat to mount or insert his penis into the female) are remarkable in that study

### 6Safety and Toxicology

#### 6.1General


Supplementation of the water extract up to 2,000mg/kg was not acutely toxic in rats.[[1]](#ref1)
