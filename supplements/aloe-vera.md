### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Aloe* is a genera of over 420 plants (of the family *Liliaceae*[[1]](#ref1)) of which *vera* (sometimes referred to as *Barbadensis*) is the specific herb used in many supplements. Other members of this family include *Aloe Ferox* and *Aloe Arborescens*.[[2]](#ref2) The *Aloe vera* plant itself is a perennial plant with turgid green leaves joined at the stem in a rosette pattern, and is most well known as a topical ointment for pain relief from burns.[[3]](#ref3)


These plants have historically been used topically to heal wounds, and internally (consumption) as a cathartic agent[[1]](#ref1) and have been used in [Ayurveda](/supplements/ayurveda/),[[4]](#ref4) Southern African medicine.[[5]](#ref5)


#### 1.2Composition


The *Aloe vera* plant specifically contains:


* The anthraquinone Aloin (aka. Barbalion; divided into Aloin A and Aloin B) and Isoaloin/Isobarbalion[[6]](#ref6)[[7]](#ref7)[[8]](#ref8) and 7-hydroxyaloin A (7-OHA) and 5-hydroxyaloin A (in Aloe *Ferox*)[[6]](#ref6)
* Anthraquinones Aloresin A and B[[6]](#ref6)

With some bioactive polysaccharides


* Aloeride[[9]](#ref9)
* Aacemannan[[9]](#ref9)

Aloe vera is known to have a sensitive processing need, and can be damaged during processing.[[10]](#ref10)

### 2Interactions with fat metabolism

In fat cells, it also suppresses scavenger receptor A and CD36 on macrophages in white adipose tissue.[[11]](#ref11) These are receptors for oxidized LDL particles, and inhibiting their actions may prevent inflammatory responses. This works in concert with Aloe's ability to inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-kB *in vivo*.[[11]](#ref11)

### 3Interactions with Oxidation

#### 3.1Mechanisms


The anti-inflammatory effects of aloe vera seem to be via aloesin derivatives and inhibiting both thromboxanes and COX2.[[12]](#ref12) It has also been implicated in suppressing Nf-kB and downstream inflammatory cytokines.[[11]](#ref11)

### 4Interactions with Hormones

#### 4.1Thyroid


In a study assessing herbal effects on the thyroid, ingestion of 125mg/kg Aloe vera for 15 days in rats was associated with a decrease in serum T4 (-12.88%) and T3 (-25.13%).[[13]](#ref13)

### 5Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 5.1Oral Cavity


One human trial using a topical patch of 0.5% Acemannan (a polysaccharide from Aloe Vera) noted that this patch was more effective than control in reducing the size of oral aphthous ulceration (Canker Sores) when applied thrice a day for a week, but failed to outperform the active control of 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide (a topical corticosterone).[[14]](#ref14) This has been noted elsewhere in recurrent canker sores, where thrice daily application of a gel (1.6% dry leaf remnant) was able to reduce the diameter of inflammation and pain and reduced healing time of the lesions.[[15]](#ref15)


#### 5.2Liver


Aloe vera leaf gel given at 1mg/kg for a week prior to administration of [alcohol](/supplements/alcohol/) (3g/kg fasted state) did not influence serum alcohol levels nor the increase in serum liver enzymes (GOP, GPT) following alcohol administration, but was able to attenuate the alcohol-induced increase in liver triglycerides via suppressing alcohol's induction of lipogenic gene mRNA expression (DGAT2, FASN, and SREBP-1; lipolytic genes not affected).[[16]](#ref16)


1mg/kg Aloe vera can increase hepatic PPARÎ± content by 1.3-fold relative to control without significantly influencing the target genes of CPT-1 and MCAD.[[16]](#ref16)

### 6Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions

#### 6.1Vitamin C and Vitamin E


Coingestion of [vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c/) (500mg) or [vitamin E](/supplements/vitamin-e/) (420mg as acetate) with Aloe vera gel results in a near tripling of the Area-Under-Curve and bioavailability for both compounds[[1]](#ref1) coupled with a delayed Tmax when consumed in a fasted state. Vitamin C went from 339+/-124 1031+/-513 and Vitamin E from 19.3+/-23.2 to 71.3+/-22.5uM/h with the addition of Aloe gel, with Aloe leaf not being statistically different from control.[[1]](#ref1) The dose of Aloe Gel was not specified.


However, this study did not note any vitamin C or E content of the Aloe itself, and was funded by the International Aloe Science Council.[[1]](#ref1)

### 7Safety and Toxicology

Aloe has been associated with acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) either in isolation[[17]](#ref17)[[18]](#ref18) or when consumed as a multinutrient supplement.[[19]](#ref19) These effects appear to be reversible and occur in the dosage range of 250-500mg a day, with the exact mechanism of the toxicity is not understood. 


Aloe seems to cause wide-ranging side-effects at a doses 100mg/kg or greater bodyweight in animals. These side effects are observed in all subjects.[[2]](#ref2)
