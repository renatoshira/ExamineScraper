### 1Sources and Summary

Chia seed (*Salvia hispanica* L of the family *Lamiaceae*) is an oilseed native to southern Mexico and northern Guatemala,[[1]](#ref1) and a dietary supplement that is used for its [dietary fiber](/supplements/dietary-fiber-prebiotic/) component, and has traditional usage as a food product (roasted seeds being referred to as *chiapinolli* in Columbia[[2]](#ref2) where it was consumed for energy[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4)). Chia appears to be classified as a grain product,[[5]](#ref5) and due to its physical properties it is sometimes used as an egg/oil substitute in bakery products.[[6]](#ref6)


#### 1.1Composition


Chia seeds contain:


* Dietary protein at 19-23% of seed weight[[5]](#ref5) (other sources giving a more variable range of 15-25%[[3]](#ref3))
* Non-fibrous carbohydrates, consisting of 26-41% of the seed by dry weight[[3]](#ref3)
* Fatty acids, between 30-33% of total seed weight[[3]](#ref3)
* Fiber, which is highly insoluble (about 5-fold more insoluble than soluble[[2]](#ref2)) and has a high water holding capacity[[7]](#ref7) and is at 9.4g of fiber per 25g serving (37.6%),[[2]](#ref2) although usually it is estimated to be around 30% dry weight[[8]](#ref8)
* [Kaempferol](/supplements/kaempferol/) (1.1mM/kg)[[9]](#ref9)
* [Quercetin](/supplements/quercetin/) (0.2mM/kg)[[9]](#ref9)
* [Myricetin](/supplements/myricetin/) (3.1mM/kg)[[9]](#ref9)
* Cinnamic acid[[9]](#ref9)
* Caffeic acid (6.6mM/kg, which increases to 13.5mM/kg when hydrolyzed) and [Chlorogenic acid](/supplements/chlorogenic-acid/) (7.1mM/kg)[[9]](#ref9)


> In general, the seeds of chia (which can be ground into a powder) have a respectable protein content of around 20% and a high fiber content of around 30%, which appears to have high water resorbing properties. The remaining 50% of the seed is split between fatty acids, carbohydrates, and some polyphenolics. No polyphenolics identified to date are unique to chia seeds


Whereas the fatty acid component (25-35% of the seed by dry weight[[2]](#ref2)) in particular contains:


* Alpha-linoleic acid (ALA, an omega-3 fatty acids with the designation of 18:2) at 4.4g per 25g (17.6%) dry weight[[2]](#ref2) but elsewhere has been noted to be 6.3% of total fatty acids[[9]](#ref9) which can be increased to 69% upon hydrolyzation.[[9]](#ref9) Usually chia is claimed to have a high ALA content in the range of 60% total fatty acids[[3]](#ref3)[[10]](#ref10)
* Linoleic acid (18:2) at 46.3% total fatty acids (declines to 15.3% after hydrolyzation)[[9]](#ref9) but commonly said to be approximately 20% of total fatty acids[[3]](#ref3)
* Oleic acid (18:1) at 21.3% total fatty acids[[9]](#ref9)
* Stearic acid (18:0) at 16.2% total fatty acids[[9]](#ref9)
* Palmitic acid (16:0) at 9.9% total fatty acids[[9]](#ref9)


> Appears to be a very high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and is generally thought to contain more omega-3 fatty acids (as ALA) relative to omega-6 fatty acids (as LA)


Total phenolics have been quantified at 47mM per 1,000g chia seeds (caffeic acid equivalents)[[9]](#ref9) and otherwise stated to be 0.8800-0.9211mg/g gallic acid equivalents of mostly flavonols.[[2]](#ref2) At least *ex vivo*, these phenolics appear to reduce lipid peroxidation and oxidation.[[2]](#ref2) The antioxidant capacity appears to be greater than other herbs in the *salvia* genera (including [Clary Sage](/supplements/salvia-sclarea/)[[11]](#ref11)) and at 0.5mL showed comparable efficacy to Trolox (concentration not stated).[[2]](#ref2)



> Appears to have a surprisingly respectable antioxidative potential when tested *ex vivo*

### 2Neurology

#### 2.1Appetite


Adding chia to a carbohydrate containing meal (50g carbohydrates, 7-24g chia) appears to result in less subjetive appetite ratings (41-68%) relative to chia-free control bread when measured up to 180 minutes after; overall food intake for the day not reported, and this decrease in appetite was correlated with blood sugar (the spike of which was attenuated following ingestion of chia).[[12]](#ref12)

### 3Cardiovascular Health

#### 3.1Blood Pressure


Chia has been found to reduce blood pressure (by 6.3+/-4.2mmHg to the level of 123+/-16mmHg systolic) with no significant influence on diastolic in type II diabetics given 15g chia per 1000kcal dietary intake (placebo of wheat bran)[[13]](#ref13) but failed to reduce blood pressure in otherwise healthy overweight adults given 50g chia (18.8g fiber) daily for 12 weeks.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 3.2Lipoproteins and Triglycerides


In both healthy overweight adults[[1]](#ref1) and type II diabetics[[13]](#ref13) given chia seeds, there is no demonstrated improvement in standard lipid panels (HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol) associated with chia consumption relative to fiber placebos.

### 4Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

#### 4.1Absorption


Chia, when added to a meal standardized to 50g carbohydrate (7-24g chia seeds), appears to reduce postprandial glucose spikes in a dose-dependent manner by 21-48% (AUC values) when measured 60 minutes after ingestion.[[12]](#ref12)


#### 4.2Interventions


Chia seeds, at 15g per 1000kcal dietary intake and compared to wheat bran as control, failed to significantly influence HbA1c or either glucose or insulin in type II diabetics.[[13]](#ref13)

### 5Fat Mass and Obesity

#### 5.1Interventions


In rats fed chia to account for dietary carbohydrates (2.6%), fatty acids (22.8%), and protein (7.75%) over three months seemed to confer an anti-obese effect by attenuating the rate of weight gain relative to control groups (Maize oil at 23% of the diet; 50% linoleic acid by weight and no omega-3 content).[[14]](#ref14) Along this reduction in fat mass came reduction in triglycerides, NEFA, and insulin resistance.[[14]](#ref14)


In overweight adults given chia seeds (9.4g dietary fiber and 130kcal twice a day, placebo given similar caloric intake from various food products) for 12 weeks failed to reduce weight to a larger degree than the placebo product (mostly consisting of tapioca and carrot fiber).[[1]](#ref1)

### 6Inflammation and Immunology

#### 6.1Interventions


Supplementation of 25g chia twice daily (18.8g fiber and 260kcal total) for 12 weeks in overweight persons has failed to influence inflammatory biomarkers of MCP, TNF-Î±, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 (control was a mixed food product to match macronutrients)[[1]](#ref1) although elsewhere a reduction of CRP has been noted in diabetics given chia seeds (15g per 1000kcal dietary intake) over wheat bran.[[13]](#ref13)

### 7Interactions with Aesthetics

#### 7.1Skin


In a small (n=5) sample of healthy persons with xerotic pruritus and persons with end stage renal disease (where xerotic pruritus increases in frequency[[15]](#ref15)), topical application of the oil of chia seeds (4% of solution) was applied for 8 weeks appeared to improve symptoms of pruritus (lichen simplex chronicus and prurigo nodularis significantly reduced, pruritus and abrasion nonsignificantly) and increase skin hydration.[[16]](#ref16) Benefits appeared to occur at 2 weeks and reach maximal effects at 4 weeks.

### 8Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 8.1Intestines


The fiber from chia tends to have a very high water holding capacity (and relatively low oil holding capacity) at up to 2.5-fold more than wheat bran, which contributes to water resorbing properties.[[7]](#ref7)

### 9Interactions with Cancer Metabolism

#### 9.1Mechanisms


Chia (n-hexane extract) has been noted to have poor antiproliferative effects *in vitro* on cancer cells from breast (MCF7), cervix (HeLa), and skin carcinoma (A431)[[17]](#ref17) while the oil has shown a beneficial modulation in eicosanoid production (less 12-HETE and arachidonic acid) in breast cancer cells (due to the alpha-linoleic acid content)[[18]](#ref18) and 6% of mouse feed prior to a mammary tumor inoculation was able to reduce tumor weight (relative to control) and reduce metastasis (relative to both control and [safflower oil](/supplements/safflower-oil/)).[[18]](#ref18)



> Weak antiproliferative effects *in vitro* and some potential anti-cancer effects on tumor proliferation that seem to simply be due to the omega-3 content of chia seeds (and thus not unique to chia containing products)
