### 1Sources and Composition

#### 1.1Sources


*Asteracantha longifolia* (of the family *Acanthaceae*, synonymous the *Hygrophila* genera (*auriculata* and *spinosa*) as well as the *Barleria* genera (*auriculata* and *spinosa*)[[1]](#ref1)) is a traditional Indian medicine[[2]](#ref2) named either Kokilaaksha or Talimakhana (Ayurvedic and Unani medicine, respectively[[1]](#ref1)) and some lesser known names of Ikshura, Ikshugandha,[[3]](#ref3) and Ikkirie.[[4]](#ref4)


*Asteracantha longifolia* belongs to the [Ayurveda](/supplements/ayurveda/) class of 'Vajikaran' for enhancement of sexual performance, and also has uses as a general tonic, sedative,[[1]](#ref1) asthma, jaundice, liver ailments, and diuretic[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6) as well as various 'diseases of the blood' and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism and edema.[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4) Traditional usage seems to recommend one ounce of the root (boiled in a pint of water until fourteen ounces remain) or two ounces of the dried leaves extracted with vinegar or water.[[4]](#ref4)



> The plant *Asteracantha longifolia* appears to be a traditionally recommended blood tonic and aphrodisiac from Indian medicine, and it is also known for its supposed liver benefits

### 2Neurology

#### 2.1Neurprotection


The terpenoid fraction of *asteracantha longifolia* (100-200mg/kg) orally for seven days in rats then subject to transient global cerebral ischemia, supplementation was associated with improvements in cognitive testing and reductions in brain lipid peroxidation with a potency comparable to 500mg/kg [Vitamin E](/supplements/vitamin-e/).[[9]](#ref9)



> May be slightly neuroprotective, which is thought to be associated with its antioxidative properties


#### 2.2Aphrodisia


An ethanolic extract of the seeds (100-200mg/kg) to rats over 28 days caused dose-dependent increaes in mounting frequency (380-472% of control) and similar reductions in mounting, intromission, and post-ejaculatory latencies; all doses were nonsignificantly more libido enhancing than the active control of 0.5mg/kg testosterone injections.[[1]](#ref1)



> Appears to have some aphrodisiac properties with prolonged ingestion, although it appears to be of comparable potency to other libido enhancing herbs in rats

### 3Cardiovascular Health

#### 3.1Blood


The chloroform extract of the leaves of *asteracantha longifolia* (250-500mg/kg intraperitoneal injections in mice) given for 22 days after cyclophosphamide-induced anemia was able to restore levels of blood cells (normalization after 15 days) indicative of haematopoietic potential.[[10]](#ref10) The suppression in bone marrow cell count was also normalized by treatment with *asteracantha longifolia*[[10]](#ref10) and elsewhere in haloperidol-induced anemic rats an ethanolic extract of the aerial parts (100-200mg/kg) given via intraperitoneal injections was able to almost normalize blood cell parameters (hematocrit, RBC count, hemoglobin) after 19 days.[[11]](#ref11)


In rats that are not anemic and given 200mg/kg of the ethanolic extract (injections), administration of the supplement does not appear to stimulate erythropoesis and is met with a small (possibly clinically irrelevant) decline relative to untreated control.[[11]](#ref11)



> In instances of anemia where administered chemicals can reduce red blood cell count and functionality, it appears that *asteracantha longifolia* can stimulate erythropoesis and normalize the differences within a few weeks. This does not work in non-anemic animals, and no studies have used oral supplemental dosages yet

### 4Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

#### 4.1Absorption


Large oral doses of the water extract of the aerial parts of the plant (leaf and stem, dosed at 5g/kg bodyweight in rats) has failed to modify the absorption of glucose.[[12]](#ref12)



> Does not appear to inhibit glucose absorption


#### 4.2Glycogen


Oral ingestion of the water extract has failed to modify gluconeogenesis in the rat liver following an oral glucose tolerance test.[[12]](#ref12)


In rats, administration of a water extract (at 5g/kg bodyweight) prior to glucose loading has resulted in increased glycogen storage in both the liver (108.5+/-9.5%) and skeletal muscle (57.8+/-4.2%) although an increase in triglyceride storage of adipose tissue (10.2+/-1.8%) was also noted.[[12]](#ref12)



> While the water extract of *astercantha longifolia* does not appear to promote nor hinder gluconeogensis, it appears that preloading this herb before carbohydrates augments the amount of glycogen that is stored in the liver and muscle tissue


#### 4.3Diabetes


100-250mg/kg of the ethanolic leaf extract for three weeks in diabetic rats is able to reduce fasting blood glucose associated with a normalization of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase) and lipid peroxidation.[[13]](#ref13)


Oral ingestion of 10mL/kg of a hot water leaf extract (where each mL is equivalent to 1g of plant material) in normal humans is able to reduce exposure to glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test by 25%; the drink was slightly more effective in diabetics since it reduced exposure by 36%.[[14]](#ref14)



> There appears to be a hypoglycemic effect when this herb is coingested with dietary carbohydrates, and this is thought to be related to the deposition of carbohydrates into muscle and the liver as glycogen

### 5Interactions with Oxidation

#### 5.1In vitro


As assessed by FTC method (used to assess peroxide formation at the initial stages), the water extract of the roots of *asteracantha longifolia* inhibited 55.29% of peroxide formation and appears to be nonsignificantly more potent than both [Vitamin E](/supplements/vitamin-e/) and [Vitamin C](/supplements/vitamin-c/) as reference compounds.[[15]](#ref15) This potency carried over to the TBS assay where the water extract inhibited 60% of MDA formation, showing another effective anti-lipid peroxidation measurement.[[15]](#ref15)



> The water extract of the roots appears to have somewhat respectable antioxidative properties against lipid peroxidation, which nonsignificantly outperform the references of vitamins C and E


[Back to top](#c-interactions-with-oxidation)
### 6Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 6.1Sexual Organs


An ethanolic extract of the seeds (100-200mg/kg) to rats over 28 days caused a dose-dependent increase in the weight of sexual organs (testicles, seminal vesicles, and epididymus) with a increase in prostatic weight that was not dose dependent.[[1]](#ref1) This same dose caused increases in semen count associated with increased spermatogenesis.[[1]](#ref1)



> There may be a small increase in male sex organ weight that occurs alongside prolonged usage of the herb and its libidoo enhancing effects


#### 6.2Liver


*In vitro*, the isolated alkaloids of *asteracantha longifolia* appear to be protective against CCL4 in liver cells in the concentration range of 40-80µg/mL with the highest tested concentration having a potency comparable to 250µg/mL Silymarins.[[16]](#ref16)



> The alkaloids appear to be the main active component


A methanolic extract of the seeds of *asteracantha longifolia* appears to have hepatoprotective properties against both thioacetamide and paracetamol[[17]](#ref17) as well as acetominophen in rats.[[18]](#ref18) Protection against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has been noted in both mouse[[19]](#ref19) and rat[[20]](#ref20) models of hepatotoxicity.


A basic water extract of the roots (50-150mg/kg) alongside CCL4 in a rat model of hepatotoxicity was able to reduce the increase in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH) as well as bilirubin; the highest dose of the root extract (150mg/kg) was comparable to the reference drug of 50mg/kg Silymarins (from [Milk thistle](/supplements/milk-thistle/)).[[15]](#ref15) Elsewhere, the total alkaloid fraction of the leaves at 80mg/kg has been found to be comparable to 250mg/kg Silmyarins.[[16]](#ref16)



> Appears to have general liver protective properties in animal studies against hepatotoxins, and the potency of this plant is either comparable or lesser than that of other reference drugs such as Milk thistle although the isolated alkaloids may be more protective

### 7Interactions with Cancer Metabolism

#### 7.1Hepatocarcinoma


A methanolic extract of the seeds (200-400mg/kg) every other day for eight weeks in rats given hepatic tumors appears to be able to reduce subsequent foci development by up to 51% (relative to control) associated with an attenuation of the toxin-induced declinein glutathione peroxidase and catalase.[[5]](#ref5)


[Back to top](#c-interactions-with-cancer-metabolism)
### 8Safety and Toxicology

#### 8.1General


Both the alkaloidal[[16]](#ref16) and terpenoid[[9]](#ref9) fractions of the plant have been found to have no acute toxicity below 2000mg/kg oral ingestion in rats.



> Preliminary and short term evidence in rats does not suggest any form of toxicity with single doses
