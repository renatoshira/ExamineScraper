### 1Source and Composition

#### 1.1General


Trichopus zeylanicus (of the family Trichopodaceae) is a herb from the areas of India, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. It has been used historically by the *Kani* tribe in India (whom call it *Arogyappacha*), which uses this plant for its purported anti-fatigue effects.[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2) It appears to possess adaptogenic properties, and may be considered an [adaptogen](/supplements/adaptogen/).[[1]](#ref1) Trichopus Zeylanicus also has been referred to as a Ginseng compound before (although not belonging to the [Panax Ginseng](/supplements/panax-ginseng/) family) and is referred to as the *Ginseng of Kerala* (or Kerala Ginseng).[[3]](#ref3)


Claims from the Kani tribe in regards to this herb state that the berries (bioactive portion) can gain enough energy to go days without food, and 1-2 berries can preserve youth, vitality, and prevent decline of the body.[[4]](#ref4)[[1]](#ref1)


#### 1.2Composition


Trichopus Zelanicus, as a herb, contains:


* An unnamed glycopeptide, possibly causative to the adaptogenic effects and found in the ethanolic fragment[[1]](#ref1)
* Sulfhydryl compounds at 2.09 ± 0.31 µg /mg[[5]](#ref5)
* NADH at 13.06 ± 3.16 ng/mg[[5]](#ref5)
* Unnamed polyphenols at 43.33 ± 6.21 µg/mg[[5]](#ref5)

### 2Exercise and Performance

#### 2.1Physical Performance


In mouse tests (young and old), 250-500mg/kg Trichopus zeylanicus added to the feed was able to improve physical performance.[[6]](#ref6) Similar effects have been seen in mice with doses ranging from 12.5-100mg/kg bodyweight of the ethanolic extract of the plant, where Trichopus at 12.5mg/kg bodyweight was roughly as effective as 125mg/kg bodyweight [Ashwagandha](/supplements/ashwagandha/), and doses ranging from 25-100mg/kg bodyweight were significantly more effective than Ashwagandha in preventing the decline in motor control and attenuating a rise in fatigue after exhaustive swimming (with subsequent physical testing immediately after).[[1]](#ref1) When assessing physical performance in the aforementioned swim task (swimming until fatigue), Trichopus Zeylanicus was able to increase swim time by 40.33% (12.5%) to 103.47% (100mg/kg) whereas Ashwagandha at 125mg/kg was only able to increase time to fatigue by 38.85%.[[1]](#ref1)


The mechanism of action by which it increases performance seems to be independent of adrenaline-mediated mechanisms.[[6]](#ref6) The effects seen may be secondary to anxiolysis (reducing [anxiety](/topics/anxiety/)) and the adaptogenic effects.[[1]](#ref1)



> Preliminary evidence suggests it is a potent performance enhancer, although whether this is *inherent* increases in performance or just secondary to a reduction in anxiety in the test animals is not known. It appears to be more potent than Ashwagandha, which is relatively impressive

### 3Intestinal Interactions

One study in mice using charcoal as a fecal marker noted that Trichopus Zeylanicus may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the speed of bowel evacuation).[[7]](#ref7)

### 4Oxidation

Trichopus Zeylanicus has been implicated in being able to exert anti-oxidant, anti-lipid peroxidation, and anti-lipoxygenase effects and protect DNA from oxidation by reactive oxygen species.[[5]](#ref5)[[8]](#ref8) The anti-oxidant effects are outperformed by an equal dose of [Ganoderma Lucidum](/supplements/ganoderma-lucidum/) while Trichopus Zeylanicus possesses more anti-lipid peroxidative effects.[[5]](#ref5)

### 5Inflammation

Trichopus Zeylanicus is able to reduce inflammation as measured by edema after carrageenan injection, and was not significantly different than [Ashwagandha](/supplements/ashwagandha/) in this regard.[[1]](#ref1)

### 6Neurology

#### 6.1Anxiety and Stress


Trichopus Zeylanicus is touted as an adaptogenic compound able to reduce stress.


One study conducted in mice measuring both inflammation (as a response to exercise) and gastric ulceration (as a response to stress) noted significant attenuation when Trichopus Zeylanicus was fed at 12.5-100mg/kg bodyweight ethanolic extract; reducing 100% ulceration rates in the control group to 82.04% (12.5mg/kg) to 41.95% (100mg/kg) with dose-dependent effects.[[1]](#ref1) These effects were slightly more potent on a per weight basis relative 125mg/kg bodyweight [Ashwagandha](/supplements/ashwagandha/) used as an active control, which suppressed levels to 59.26% of control.[[1]](#ref1) Trichopus was also able to dose-dependently reduce rectal hypothermia, a biomarker of stress, and all doses were slightly more effective than Ashwagandha.[[1]](#ref1)


#### 6.2Aphrodisia


Trichopus Zeylanicus appears to have aphrodisiac properties in male mice through a fat soluble component at 200mg/kg bodyweight.[[9]](#ref9)

### 7Safety

Two tests (performed by the same researchers) and one by another research group note that the LD50 value was greater than 3g/kg bodyweight[[1]](#ref1)[[3]](#ref3)[[2]](#ref2) and that consumption of up to 3g of this herb (and 100mg of the ethanolic extract) for up to 15 days showed no observable abnormalities.
