Sources and Synthesis

1.1

Sources

ALA is a naturally occurring compound with the chemical name 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, sometimes referred to as thioctic acid.[1]

ALA can be found in food, mostly meat like organ tissue, and in some fruits and vegetables.[2][3] Some specific contents include:

Spinach at 3.14+/-1.11mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Kidney at 2.64+/-1.23mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Liver at 1.51+/-0.75mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Broccoli at 0.94+/-0.25mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Heart Tissue at 0.86+/-0.33mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Tomatoes at 0.56+/-0.23mcg/g dry weight as lipoyllysine[4][5]Lipoyllysine is a lipoic acid molecule bound to a lysine amino acid, and is a food storage form of alpha-lipoic acid that is bound to the proteins.[6] It is separated into lipoic acid and lysine via the glycoprotein enzyme lipoamidase (sometimes referred to as lipoyllysine hydrolase), which circulates in human serum.[7]


Lipoic acid is found in a variety of food sources, but the levels found in food tend to be significantly lower than standard supplemental dosages.


1.2

Biosynthesis

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring dithiol compound created in the mitochondria from octanoic acid as a precursor, with a good deal of synthesis occurring in the liver's mitochondria.[8][3]

Its main biological role is as a cofactor in mitochondrial enzymes such as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.[9] ALA also appears to be involved in the production of acetyl-CoA, via oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate.[10]

Supplementation has been found to provide protective benefits against oxidation, inflammation, diabetes, and cognitive decline.[9]

1.3

Structure and Stability

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) possesses a chiral center carbon and thus can exist in an S or R isomer. Unspecified ALA is a 'racemic' solution of both, while R-ALA is often sold as well, commonly bound to sodium (Na-R-ALA).

The disulfide bond in alpha-lipoic acid can be homolytically cleaved by near UV light and heat[11][12] during which the dithiolane ring structure forms two thiyl radicals and self-polymerizes into a linear chain of disulfides known as PBCPD. The full name is poly{3-(n-butane carboxylic acid)propyl}disulfide.[13] This polymerization is seen as reversible, with conversion back into ALA in alkaline solution or with coincubation with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol.[14] It has been suggested that naturally occurring ALA may be a racemic mixture including a PBCPD content.[15]

In vivo, ALA can be reduced to dithiol form (where the ring structure is broken), dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA).[3] In cells with mitochondria, this reduction is mediated by lipoamide dehydrogenase and is an NADH-dependent reaction. In cells without mitochondria, this reduction occurs via NADPH with glutathione and thioredoxin reductases.[16]

ALA has a melting point of 63°C when in racemic solution and 50°C as the R-ALA isomer, and pairing with salts with higher boiling points may enhance stability, a common venture for patents.[17][18]

Pharmacology

2.1

Absorption

Orally ingested Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is rapidly taken up in the gut in a pH dependent manner by monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCTs). Coingestion with monocarboxylic acids such as medium-chain triglycerides or benzoic acid inhibits ALA uptake.[19] There is also the potential for ALA to be taken up by the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT).[20][21] In the gut, some ALA converts into dihydrolipoic acid. The overall bioavailability of ALA supplementation is approximately 30%[22][9] due to high liver extraction.[23] The Na-R-ALA form of ALA is completely soluble in water.[24] Although the R-enantiomer has higher intestinal uptake rates in vivo,[25] the S-enantiomer may stabilize uptake by preventing polymerization.[9]


ALA is taken up moderately well, uses the MCT transporter, and may not be absorbed as well if taken alongside medium-chained triglycerides.


2.2

Serum

Systemic pharmacokinetics of ALA are fairly rapid. After rapid intestinal uptake, it is quickly partitioned to tissues that uptake ALA (brain, heart, and muscle) which includes a transient liver storage of ALA.[9][26] ALA accumulates in the brain as soon as an hour after ingestion[27] and is stored in various brain regions.[28]

After oral ingestion of 600mg ALA racemic mixture, the Cmax appears to be 6.86+/-1.29µg/mL with a Tmax of 50.8 minutes and an overall 8 hour AUC of 5.65+/-0.79µg/mL/h.[29]

2.3

Metabolism

In cells, ALA is primarily metabolized via beta-oxidation.[30] The main metabolites are bisnorlipoate, tetranorlipoate, β-hydroxy-bisnorlipoate, or the bis-methylated mercapto derivatives of these compounds[26] and dihydrolipoic acid, which undergoes rapid cellular excretion.[16]

2.4

Elimination

ALA is also rapidly excreted by filtration in the kidneys, with 98% of digested ALA excreted within 24 hours[23]. However, most orally ingested ALA is lost in fecal excretion prior to intestinal uptake.[30] For these reasons, ALA is not stored long-term. According to Shay et al.[9] the average AUC is approximately 160+/-35ug/ml/min and the average Cmax is 2.8+/-1.5 for a 600mg oral dose of both enantiomers. These results rival Na-R-ALA for AUC (despite R-ALA showing higher peak values and faster excretion) but are well ahead of S-ALA in isolation.[25]


The majority of supplemental ALA does not appear to be stored for longer than a day.


2.5

Metal Chelation

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) as well as its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid bind to metals in vitro, with the former binding to copper, lead, and zinc while the reduced form of dihydrolipoic acid binds to those three as well as mercury and iron(III).[31] Due to selenium and manganese deficiency being symptoms of ALA toxicity[32], it seems ALA or its metabolites can bind to these two metals as well.

In vivo, ALA has been observed to reduce iron levels in the brain and liver, but only when the iron level is above normal.[33][34] These results preliminarily suggest that ALA does not negatively affect the mineral status of the body.

3.

Life Extension and Longevity

3.1

Mechanisms

It has been hypothesized that the longevity promoting aspects of ALA are due to PPAR gamma cofactor 1 (PCG-1a) activation,[35] a mechanism shared by Pyrroloquinoline Quinone.

In liver cells, alpha-lipoic acid has been found to increase oxygen consumption to 189% of baseline when given to old rats at 0.5% of the diet while it nonsignificantly increase oxygen consumption to 104% of baseline in younger rats.[36] Initially the older rats had 59% of the level of oxidation relative to younger rats, and after supplementation there were no significant differences.[36] This normalization of mitochondrial oxygen capacity has been recorded in neural tissue as well, where increased oxygen consumption coupled with increased anti-oxidative potential improved neural consequences of aging (such as memory loss) in old rats fed 0.5%/1.5% ALA/ALCAR (a form of L-Carnitine).[37][38]

This increased oxygen consumption is associated with fewer parameters of oxidation when ALA at 0.5% of feed is supplemented or a combination of ALA and L-Carnitine (as ALCAR) is supplemented. ALCAR at 1.5% of feed in isolation can increase oxidation.[39] The 30.8% increase in oxidation seen with aging (relative to control) in this study was abolished with combination therapy and normalized to the level of youthful rats. Aging was measured by MDA, Ascorbate, and 2',7'-dichlorofluoresin appearance.[39] This decrease in oxidation is also associated with a lesser decline of mitochondrial enzymes, which appears as an increase from pre-supplementation levels.[40][41]


Supplementation of Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) alone increases oxidative consumption (indicative of metabolic activity) in a similar manner to L-Carnitine in aged animals, which improves functional performance. ALA can also curb the pro-oxidative effects of L-Carnitine, demonstrating practical synergism.


3.2

Animal Interventions

A rat study assessing Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) and diet interactions concluded, after following 12 groups of rats for their lifetimes, that supplementation at a dose that does not interfere with food intake (1.5g/kg in rats) does not appear to augment the efficacy of caloric restriction nor enhance ad libitum (no control) feeding per se, but that (1) although rats that switch to caloric restriction after 12 months of age (30% of lifespan) show similar life extension to lifelong caloric restriction, rats previously fed ad libitum with ALA did not, and (2) switching from caloric restriction to ad libitum feeding at 12 months normally attenuates the life extension effects of caloric restriction, but this was not seen when refeeding occurred with ALA despite an increase in growth rates.[5] The former inhibition of longevity and promotion of longevity (respectively) were lesser in magnitude with a shorter supplementation time.[5]

One study simply administering ALA to immunosuppressed mice found that both isomers of ALA were able to increase longevity with the S-isomer at 75mg/kg daily and the R-isomer at 9mg/kg daily. High doses of 350mg/kg appeared to act to reduce lifespan.[42]

In regard to an anti-aging phenotype (giving the appearance of youth without impacting median of maximal lifespan), supplementation of ALA has been demonstrated to increase the metabolic rate and activity levels of older rats, to a greater extent than seen in younger rats. Due to increasing activity levels more in older rats than younger rats, ALA supplementation reduced the differences between groups.[39]

4.

Neurology and the Brain

4.1

Appetite

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) has been demonstrated to inhibit AMPK in the hypothalamus (as opposed to other areas of the body, where it has a stimulatory effect) and due to mimicking a caloric surplus can suppress appetite. These effects may be secondary to increasing glucose uptake into the hypothalamus, and are reversed upon AMPK activation in the hypothalamus.[43] ALA at 0.25, 0.5, and 1% of the overall food intake of rats over 2 weeks and when tested over the period of 14 weeks was able to reduce body weight relative to unsupplemented control.[43] The reduction in food intake in rats does not appear to be secondary to a conditioned taste aversion, which should be noted due to ALA's sharp taste.[43] Another rat study using 200mg/kg oral intake found that this suppression of hypothalamic AMPK paired with adipose expression of AMPK helped to normalize changes in fat mass associated in a model of menopause.[44]

In older rats fed 0.75% ALA, this reduction in food relative to control has been quantified at ranges of 18%[45] to 30%,[46] and many other studies that note food intake as secondary observations tend to note decreases that reach statistical significance[47][48][44][49][46][50][51] or trends towards significance.[52] The reproducability of this seems to be high enough that, in some trials irrelevant to food intake, a third 'pair-fed' group is planned at the onset to match the experimental group for intake and control for the effects of ALA against the effects of food deprivation per se.[53][54][55][56]

This suppression of appetite seems to influence both low-fat and high-fat diets, as one rat study that supplemented ALA to both groups noted non-significant differences in overall weight loss (-24% and -29% in low and high fat; respectively and relative to high fat control)[46]

The only human study to be conducted on ALA at 600mg and appetite was conducted in schizophrenic patients and confirmed appetite suppression with increased energy (subjective rating), but had a very low sample size.[57]


ALA appears to be a potent appetite suppressant in research animals, and is consistent in the appetite suppressing effects. It is surprisingly underresearched in humans, but may have the same effects.


Some studies do note an attenuation of appetite suppression (less significance) about two weeks after consumption, so these effects may be short term and they do not seem to be fully abolished.


4.2

Mechanisms

Alpha-lipoic acid has been noted to reduce oxidative damage in neuronal cells[58] and aged rats at 100mg/kg,[28] which is thought to underlie the reductions in age-related cognitive decline.[59][60][37][61]

It has been noted that ALA does not alter basal calcium concentrations in a neuron at lower concentrations (5-50μg/mL) nor did it augment the calcium response to glutamate, yet 500μg/mL is able to increase basal calcium influx and suppress glutamate induced signaling.[62]

ALA has also been found to inhibit T-currents (specifically, via the CaV3.2 channel) with an IC50 of 3+/-1μM, reaching maximal inhibition of around 40% at 100-1,000μM. This appears to be mediated via a REDOX reaction on the calcium channel.[63]

4.3

Glutaminergic Neurotransmission

Alpha-lipoic acid (0.05-1µM) appears to facilitate the calcium-dependent release of glutamate from the synapse via a PKA/PKC dependent mechanism, the magnitude of which reached around 27.3+/-3.1%.[64]


ALA may facilitate the release of glutamate at the presynatic level, which would theoretically enhance signaling through glutaminergic receptors.


It has been noted that incubation of glial cells with alpha-lipoic acid (10-50μM) increases glutamine synthetase activity in astrocytes and increases glutamate uptake by around 20% (and subsequent glutathione production by 40%),[65] a mechanism similar to resveratrol. This appears to be mediated via PKC but not PI3K.[65]


ALA appears to stimulate glutamate uptake into glial cells for conversion into glutamine, which theoretically suppresses signaling.


ALA does not appear to alter the synaptic membrane potential of glutamate signaling[64] and when investigating the NDMA receptors, researchers found alpha-lipoic acid to both suppress signaling (as ALA) or enhance signaling (as the reduced form DHLA).[66] 

Interestingly, the age-related deficits in NMDA receptor Bmax appear to be normalized with alpha-lipoic acid in aged mice.[67]


Alpha-lipoic acid is able to modulate the REDOX site of the NMDA receptor, but since it works in both directions its overall actions on receptor signaling are unclear. However, at least one study suggest a possible increase in NMDA receptor density in older subjects.


The excitotoxicity seen with excess glutamate appears to be reduced with alpha-lipoic acid (100µM or above), which seems to be secondary to preserving glutathione concentrations in the neuron.[68][69][70] A reduction in NMDA-induced lesions has also been confirmed in rats injected with 10mg/kg ALA for 10 days, reaching about a halving in lesion size.[71]


Alpha-lipoic acid appears to be neuroprotective against glutamate-induced toxicity secondary to supporting the glutathione pool (its depletion precedes cellular death), a mechanism similar to N-acetylcysteine.


In pilocarpine-induced seizures, an intraperitoneal injection of 10mg/kg alpha-lipoic acid is able to normalize the increase in glutamate seen with pilocarpine.[72] This was associated with a preservation of taurine[72] and aspartate[73] concentrations as well.

The increase in glutamate seen with cyanide toxicity (which releases glutamate[74], while neurotoxicity is thought to be mediated via the NMDA receptor[75]) appears to be attenuated with 25-100mg/kg ALA.[76]


The elevation in glutamate concentrations seen in pathological conditions or toxin administration appears to be able to be attenuated with preadministration of alpha-lipoic acid.


4.4

Cholinergic Neurotransmission

An animal study assessing the interactions of ALA and pilocarpine (a cholinergic agonist capable of inducing seizures) found that 10mg/kg ALA was able to reduce pilocarpine-induced seizures by 50% and prolong time to seizure by 112% if it was unable to outright prevent a seizure.[77]

4.5

Dopaminergic Neurotransmission

A study in which rats were fed low doses (10, 20, or 30mg/kg bodyweight) ALA found that 20mg/kg bodyweight was able to increase dopamine levels in the hippocampus by about 9% 24 hours after ingestion, yet the other two doses (10 and 30mg/kg) were not significantly different than control.[78] Another study using 10mg/kg found no effect.[77]

Alterations in dopamine (decrease) and dopamine metabolite (increase) levels associated with pilocarpin-induced seizures has been normalized with 10mg/kg pre-treatment ALA.[77]

4.6

Serotonergic Signaling

A study in rats found a decrease in hippocampal serotonin by 9% and its main metabolite, H-IAA, by 21% when consumed at 20mg/kg bodyweight (but not 10 or 30) and measured 24 hours later.[78] Another study using 10mg/kg found no effect.[77]

4.7

Adrenergic (Adrenaline) Signaling

A rat study found 11% increased noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus associated with 20mg/kg ALA supplementation after 24 hours, while the other two tested doses (10 and 30mg/kg) were not significantly different than control.[78] Another study using 10mg/kg found no effect.[77]

A significant reduction in noradrenaline levels in the brain associated with pilocarpine (experimental seizure inducer) has been abolished by pre-treatment with ALA at 10mg/kg in rats.[77]

4.8

Oxidation

In an aforementioned study noting alterations in monoamines at 20mg/kg oral dose yet not 10mg/kg nor 30mg/kg, a reduction of lipid peroxidation was observed that also only occurred at this dose.[78] The study has been duplicated in the literature.[79]

5.

Nerve function

5.1

General

One study has been conducted with ALA on people with compressive radiculopathy syndrome from disc-nerve root conflict. Researchers found that 600mg of ALA daily (paired with 360mg gamma-linoleic acid) in conjunction with a physical rehabilitation program was synergistic with the physical rehabilitation program and promoted nerve recovery over 6 weeks.[80]

5.2

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), at least in the early stages of disease progression, has been shown to be slowed in terms of disease progression and symptoms of CTS (when CTS is at a moderate-severe level) after supplementation of an ALA multinutrient (main confound was gamma-linoleic acid) at 600mg and 360mg, respectively, over the source of 90 days.[81]

5.3

Diabetic Neuropathy

One study paired ALA with oral superoxide dismutase (an anti-oxidant enzyme) and found significant reductions in diabetic neuropathy as assessed by subjective pain and electroneurographic parameters.[82]

A 4-year trial of ALA on diabetic neuropathy using 600mg ALA daily failed to show a significant difference in primary outcomes between groups (Neuropathy Impairment Score, neurophysiological tests) yet the ALA group showed significant improvements relative to their own baseline value.[83] This trial could not establish a protective effect of ALA, however, since placebo did not deteriote over time.[83]

6.

Interactions with the Liver

6.1

Mechanisms

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) can induce triglyceride lipase expression in liver cells (responsible for decreasing triglyceride strorages in these cells[84]) secondary to AMPK activation, which decreased lipid accumulation in vitro.[85] AMPK was activated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and was able to do so despite high glucose (30mM) and palmitate (0.1mM) concentrations at concentrations of 0.25-1mM.[85] These AMPK interactions are independent of Sirtuin proteins, and appear to circumvent insulins actions on the nuclear transcription factor FOXO1 by preventing nuclear exclusion, which appears to be secondary to AMPK as well.[85] When fed to genetically obese rats, 2.4% ALA of the diet for 5 weeks (about 40mg/kg bodyweight in this study after controlling for 20% bioavailability) is able to reduce triglyceride accumulation in liver tissue (-26%) and increase glycogen content (+27%). Relative to calorically restricted rats, the LA group had larger livers without abnormal biomarkers, possibly due to the glycogen content.[53]

Superoxide anion production in the liver of rats fed 1% ALA also appears to be reduced relative to control, and the increase in superoxide production in response to added glucose to the diet, for the most part, abolished.[48]

AMPK is not the sole mechanism of reducing fat accumulation in the liver, and can inhibit the genetic actions of pro-lipogenic proteins LXR and specificity protein 1.[86] ALA may increase the protein content of PPARα receptors when fed at 1% of the diet over a period of 14 weeks and was negatively correlated (r=0.8) with blood free fatty acid levels.[48]

Although the beneficial effects of ALA on liver physiology in aforementioned models are well-established, one study comparing the effects of long- vs. short-term ALA supplementation in healthy mice suggests that regular, long term supplementation may cause liver damage, and should be considered with caution.[87]

To examine the effect of short- vs. long-term ALA supplementation on the liver, “black 6” mice (C57BL6/J, a common laboratory mouse strain) were treated with 20mg/kg ALA for 4 or 74 weeks.[87] After the treatment period, mice were euthanized followed by liver tissue analysis for lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Short- and long-term ALA supplementation caused an increase in β-oxidation and decreased lipogenesis. In contrast, both short and long term ALA treatment increased liver cholesterol content by 70% and 110%, respectively, and increased triglyceride levels, inducing systemic triglyceridemia. Moreover, in spite of the fact that short-term ALA treatment decreased lipogenic gene expression, it also caused fat accumulation in the liver. Long-term ALA treated mice showed a worse phenotype, with extensive fat accumulation leading to hepatic steatosis and extensive liver damage.[87]

Notably, the above study was unique in that it investigated the effects of long term ALA treatment in otherwise healthy mice. In contrast, other studies that have shown a beneficial effect of longer term ALA treatment were conducted in rodent disease models, including high fat diet fed rats[88] and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats.[89] Thus, long-term ALA treatment in healthy animal models may be liver toxic, causing a phenotype that closely resembles that of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.[90][91] It should be noted that the dose of ALA in the healthy mouse study[87] of 20mg/kg is equivalent to approximately 146 mg/day in a 200 lb human. Although this is a relatively high dose of ALA, it is close enough to standard doses that caution may be warranted for long-term supplementation. 


Although ALA has been shown to decrease oxidative stress and improve lipid metabolism in animal disease models, one study in healthy mice suggests that long term treatment may be liver toxic, causing damage that resembles non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since the effects of long term ALA supplementation in humans have not been studied, it is not currently known whether long-term high dose ALA may have similar detrimental effects in humans.


7.

Interactions with Obesity and Body Fat

7.1

Mechanisms

The following mechanisms are those that are independent of appetite suppression. As evidence by the appetite summary (Neurology Header, subsection 1) ALA has potent effects on reducing appetite. However, even when a third group has their energy intake restricted to match the intake of a group with appetite suppression (known as pair-fed feeding) ALA appears to induce some manner of weight loss beyond mere appetite suppression (although appetite suppression appears to be the most potent influencing factor).[49] At least one pair-fed study (control group, group fed ALA, third group fed only the amount of calories the ALA group wanted to consume) found that the statistically significant weight loss became insignificantly different between pair fed and ALA supplemented.[53]


The most significant factor influencing alpha-lipoic acid's weight reducing effects is the reduction of appetite, and pair-fed studies suggest this may account for 80-90% (rough estimate derived from charts) of the overall weight-reducing effects secondary to ALA.


In vitro, lipoic acid was able to induce apelin secretion from fat cells (an adipokine that may regluate glucose metabolism) but was deemed to be unrelated to changes seen in vivo.[47]

In regard to AMPK, at least one study has seen results that suggest AMPK inhibition could be at play in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but the study was not designed to answer these questions.[47] Two other studies note that in white adipose tissue AMPK is both activated and its mRNA upregulated.[54][44]

When investigating the interactions of ALA and nutrient absorption, supplemental ALA for 56 days was able to reduce carbohydate uptake secondary to inhibiting the SGLT1 transport (sodium dependent glucose transporter) by approximately a third, when the jujenum was excised and tested in vitro with alpha-methylglucose.[49] When tested in vivo at 0.5% ALA though, there are no significant differences in the caloric content of the feces with ALA (assessed by bomb calorimetry).[46]


ALA has the potential to inhibit nutrient uptake, but does not appear to be potent enough to be meaningful.


7.2

Energy Expenditure

In animals fed 0.5% of food intake as ALA when caloric intake was controlled (as ALA may suppress appetite), energy expenditure as assessed by indirect calorimetry increased by day 3 and continued to be elevated for the 21 tested days.[43] These rats showed increased expression of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue and ectopic ex
