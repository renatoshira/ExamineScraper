### 1Sources and Composition

Dendrobium species of plants are apparently highly prized medicinal medicines, in regards to being a 'stomach tonic' and the *candidum* species is known for aiding body fluid excretion (saliva, tears).[[1]](#ref1) There are around 200 species of Dendrobium,[[2]](#ref2) although only a few have been used medicinally.


Dendrobium *moniliforme* is referred to as Shi-Hu in [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/supplements/traditional-chinese-medicine/),[[3]](#ref3) and Dendrobium *Nobile* is referred to as Seokgok in Korean Medicine.[[4]](#ref4)


#### 1.1Composition


Dendrobium includes a variety of bioactives, including (species listed in brackets):


* SG-168 (*nobile*)[[5]](#ref5)[[1]](#ref1)
* Various alkaloids (*nobile*)[[6]](#ref6) such as Dendroxine[[7]](#ref7)
* Denbinobin (*nobile*) an anticancer phenanthraquinone[[8]](#ref8)[[3]](#ref3) also in *moniliforme*[[9]](#ref9)
* Nobilin D and E (*nobile* stem)[[10]](#ref10) and Dendroflorin[[11]](#ref11)
* Moscatilin (*loddigesii*)[[12]](#ref12)
* Dendrocandins F-I(*candidum*)[[13]](#ref13) and later C and E[[14]](#ref14)
* Chrysotoxine[[15]](#ref15)
* Sequesterpene aglycones such as copacamphane, picrotoxane, and alloaromadendrane (*moniliforme* stem)[[16]](#ref16) as well as dendrosides A, C, and F as well as vanilloloside
* Dendrochrysanene (*chrysanthum* stem)[[8]](#ref8)
* Batatasin III, gigantol, hircinol and 7-methoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2,4,5-triol (*draconis* stem) which are associated with 'blood tonic' tea in Thailand.[[17]](#ref17)[[18]](#ref18) Gigantol and Hircinol are also found in other species (*trigonopus*)[[19]](#ref19)
* Neutral polysaccharide (*Densiflorum*)[[20]](#ref20)
* Two lectins from *Dendrobium findleyanum* with anti-fungal activities[[1]](#ref1) also in *Officinale*[[21]](#ref21)
* Chalcone, an aromatic ketone used in anthocyanin synthesis (*sonia*)[[22]](#ref22)
* Dihydroayapin (*densiflorum*)[[23]](#ref23)
* Possibly sucrose, due to presence of sucrose synthesis enzymes (*officinale*)[[24]](#ref24)
* Nucleic acids (Adenosine, Uridine, Guanosine) and other acids (*candidum*)[[25]](#ref25)
* Physcione and Rhein (found in [Senna](/supplements/senna-alexandrina/)) in stems(*fimbriatum*)[[26]](#ref26)


> Different species in the *Dendrobium* family appear to have widely different bioactives, and the exact species of the plant consuming is probably going to be very important to know

### 2Digestion

#### 2.1Salivation


Currently, one of the few human studies on Dendrobium has been conducted in persons with Sjögren's syndrome (autoimmune syndrome where salivary and tear ducts are targeted) noted improvements in salivation.[[27]](#ref27) It was thought to help due to Sjögren's syndrome being characterized by abnormally low distribution of Aquaporin-5 in the salivary glands of these patients[[28]](#ref28) and previous animal models establishing that abolishment of AQP-5 results in a 65% reduction in salivation.[[29]](#ref29) This study, using a liquid form of *Dendrobium Candidum* at a 0.5g/mL concentration with 5mL aliquiots (so, 2.5g doses thrice a day for a weeks time) and it appeared to increase salivation rates by approximately 65% in persons with treatment relative to placebo.[[27]](#ref27) This increase in salivation was accompanied by a normalization of AQP-5, where the protein was not expressed at the apical membrane of Sjögren's patients but was after *Dendrobium* treatment, the increase was about 35% relative to placebo.[[27]](#ref27) In mice, Dendrobium reduced water intake suggesting it could aid dry mouth symptoms[[27]](#ref27) and it is suggested this may be due to the polysaccharide content and potentially have some cross-over with Dendrobium *officinale*.[[30]](#ref30)



> Demonstrated in at least on human trial to increase salivation, but the trial was in persons with Sjögren's syndrome and may not apply to persons without

### 4Interactions with Organ Systems

#### 4.1Liver


Anti-proliferative activities have been seen with the methanolic extract (and attributed to three phenanthrenes) of Dendrobium Nobile *in vitro* with immortalized rat HSC-T6 cells, which suggest anti-fibrotic activities of this extract in these isolated stellate cells.[[31]](#ref31) These three phenanthrenes, denbinobin (DEN), fimbriol-B (FIM) and 2,3,5-trihydroxy-4,9-dimethoxyphenanthrene (THDMP) were reassessed in HSC-T6 cells and noted that they were nontoxic to primary liver cells, yet caused a dose dependent reduction in HSC-T6 cells at 1-50uM attibuted to apoptosis.[[4]](#ref4) The growth inhibitory actions of these phenanthrenes was similar to EGCG from [green tea catechins](/supplements/green-tea-catechins/)[[4]](#ref4) and has also been suggested to apply to Dendrobium *huoshanense*, another medicinal species.[[32]](#ref32)

### 5Cancer Metabolism

#### 5.1Leukemia


Dendrobin, a phenanthrene isolated from *Dendrobium moniliforme* and *Nobile*, appears to have anti-cancer potential.

### 6Immunology and Inflammation

#### 6.1Macrophages


When Dendrobium *Nobile* has its phenanthrenes tested (showing efficacy in reducing liver fibrosis *in vitro*) they do not appear to significantly influence TNF-α production in stimulated macrophages by LPS[[4]](#ref4) although this inhibition has been noted in RAW 264.7 macrophages elsewhere with moderate potencies (9.6μM to 35.7μM).[[33]](#ref33) However, TNF-α induced inflammation (as well as PMA-induced) via NF-kB translocation has been demonstrated to be inhibited by Denbinobin, also in *Nobile*.[[3]](#ref3) This study was done in leukemic cells, and noted that Denbinobin inhibited NF-kB secondary to TAK1 inhibition, which prevented IKK and IκBα activation at 2.5uM.[[3]](#ref3) This inhibition of NF-kB has been noted previously in HIV-1 cells,[[34]](#ref34) and does not interfere with MAPK, ERK, JNK, or p38 signalling.[[3]](#ref3)


#### 6.2Interventions


Oral administration of Dendrobum *officinale* polysaccharides to mice appears to beneficially influence cellular immunity and nonspecific immunity while a non-polysaccharide fragment exerts benefit to humoral immunity.[[35]](#ref35)


The *huoshanense* species, in a pilot study in youth (4-18), appears to benefit atopic dermatitis symptoms, and reduce circulating cytokines assocaited with atopic dermatitis.[[36]](#ref36)
