Vitamin C (officially known as L-ascorbic acid, its prolonged name being 2-oxo-L-threo-hexono-1,4-lactone-2,3-enediol) is an Essential Vitamin, first structurally identified
by Szent-Gyorgyi, Waugh, and King in 1932-1935[1][2] and first synthesized by Haworth and Hirst in 1933.[3] It has been popularized mostly by Linus Pauling for prevention of the common cold[4][5][6] and has since been said to be the most popular supplement in the world.[7]

Vitamin C is most commonly supplemented because of its potential protection against the common cold,[8] and purported anticancer effects.[9] Athletes report using vitamin C for both the antioxidant properties and potential immune support.[10]

The current recommendations for Vitamin C intake (according to the FDA) appears to be 75-90mg daily (females and males, respectively) for adults with increases of 10mg for pregnancy, 45mg for lactation, and 35mg for smokers.[11] Children require around 15-45mg daily and adolescents 65-75mg, while infants (12 months or less) appears to require 40-50mg daily; youth do not have differences in dosage based upon gender until adolescence is reached.[11]

Average dietary intakes have been reported to be 152+/-83.7mg in spain,[12]


Vitamin C is a relatively safe micronutrient that is a common supplement for its antioxidant properties and reported benefits against the common cold. Average dietary intakes are in the sufficiency range (above what the RDA recommends) although the lowest groups of vitamin C intake are under the recommendations


Particularly rich sources of Vitamin C include:

Kiwi fruits (290-800mg/kg in the deliciosa (common) species and 370-1850mg/kg in argutafruit[13])Whereas the most common or significant dietary sources of Vitamin C include:

Citrus Fruits (29.6% in spain,[12] usually oranges[14]) and 9% in the US (all fruits inclusive[15])Noncitrus fruits (21.5% in spain,[12] usually apples[14])Juices (6.3% in spain[12] and 25-34% in the US[16][15])Fruiting vegetables (usually peppers and sweet peppers) at 20% in spain[12] and 23% in the US (all vegetables inclusive[15])Potatoes (3.9% in spain[12])Leafy green vegetables (6.7% in spain[12])Cruciferous vegetables (2.9% in spain[12])Fortified cereals (4% in US[15])
Fruits tend to be the highest food source of vitamin C, and in mediterraean countries they also appear to be a predominant source of vitamin C in the average diet. In the US, juices appear to contribute a significant amount of vitamin C to the diet


1.2

Biological Significance

Vitamin C appears to be a cofactor for proper collagen synthesis, L-carnitine biosynthesis (interestingly not mandatory[17]), and some neurotransmitters (particularly catecholamines).[7] In the body it maintains an overall pool of around 1,500-2,000mg that can be maintained with 75mg daily intake and saturated with 140mg daily.[7] In the body, Vitamin C has a half-life of 10–20 days with a bodily turnover of 1mg/kg and at the serum concentration of 50μM it has a bodily pool of approximately 22mg/kg[18][19] (50μM is right in the middle of the 40-60μM range found in humans[20][21]).

The biosynthesis of L-Carnitine (β-hydroxy butyric acid) that requires Vitamin C is not as a substrate, but as a necessary cofactor (iron and alpha-ketoglutarate are also required cofactors).[22] This is similar to the biosynthesis of catecholamines, as the dopamine-β-hydroxylase enzyme that converts dopamine into noradrenaline (which subsequently converts into adrenaline) is Vitamin C dependent.[23] Other enzymes that Vitamin C is known to positively modulate include those involved in the synthesis of oxytocin, vasopressin, cholecystokinin and α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.[24]


Vitamin C is required in the human body since it is required by some critical enzymes, particular those that synthesize L-Carnitine and the neurotransmitters known as catecholamines (dopamine and adrenaline). It also influences a few other neurotransmitters, and is required for proper collagen (joint) synthesis rates


Biosynthesis of Vitamin C can normally occur from either glucose or galactose being converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which then is converted to uridine diphosphate glucose and (via uridine diphosphate glucuoronic acid) into L-glucuronic acid. This molecule is then converted into L-glucuronolactone, L-gulono-γ-lactone, and then via the enzyme known as gulonolactone oxidase it is converted into L-keto-gulono-γ-lactone and Vitamin C.[7] Humans (as well as guinea pigs, fruit eating bats, and apes) cannot follow the above biosynthetic pathway as the gulonolactone oxidase enzyme does not exist within us.[7][25]

Due to the inability to synthesize Vitamin C, it needs to be obtained via the diet. A failure to get sufficient Vitamin C in the diet results in scurvy,[26][27] and the ability of a molecule to prevent scurvy (of which Vitamin C is the reference drug) is known as being anti-scorbutic.[28]


Vitamin C can normally be synthesized in animals such as canines and felines, but humans do not have an ability to synthesize Vitamin C. If Vitamin C is not obtained via the diet, then a human will eventually get scurvy


While scurvy is the clinical deficiency state (and is true 'Vitamin C deficiency'), there are various states associated with excessive oxidation which serum vitamin C tends to be reduced (or at least the REDOX balanced altered suggesting a prooxidative state) relative to healthy cohorts. This includes fever and viral infections, stress, alcoholism,[7] smoking,[29][30] type II diabetes[31][32] despite consuming adequate vitamin C,[33] and in persons who have very recently suffered a myocardial infarction[34][35] or acute pancreatitis (these last two normalizing after some time).[36][37]

It has been noted[38] that it is still unclear whether the disease state causes a depletion in vitamin C or vice versa (vitamin C depletion exacerbates the progression of the above states) or whether it is merely a biomarker of a poor diet (this is seen in smokers[39]); at least in myocardial infarction[40] and acute pancreatitis,[41] there is a drastic increase in oxidation rapidly and both diabetes[42] and smoking[29] are associated with elevated chronic oxidation.


Vitamin C depletion (not to a clinical state where scurvey results) is associated with a variety of disease states. The reason for these observations is not fully clear, and the role vitamin C therapy could play in these states is similarly not clear


1.3

Structure and Properties

Vitamin C appears to stable in food (as the form of L-ascorbic acid) in the pH range of 4-6[7]

1.4

Supplement Variants and Specifications

European regulation state that any supplement with the label 'Vitamin C' may be one of five compounds; L-Ascorbic Acid (actual vitamin C), Sodium-L-Ascorbate, Potassium-L-Ascorbate, Calcium-L-Ascorbate, and L-Ascorbyl-6-Palmitate.[43] For vitamin-related purposes, they are equipotent.

They differ on some parameters such as DNA oxidation where Sodium Ascorbate and Ascorbic Acid (the main dietary form) could exert pro-oxidative effects on DNA, Calcium Ascorbate acting neutral on DNA and Ascorbyl-6-Palmitate being protective on DNA.[44] Due to this, it appears that Ascorbyl-6-Palmitate is used often in antioxidant supplements,[7] but does not have water solubility.


'Vitamin C' on the label may refer to one of five different molecules, but all of them are able to act as a vitamin in the body. There may be some small differences between the molecules


Ester-C is a brand name product (patented by Zila Nutraceuticals) for Vitamin C that consists of Vitamin C metabolites (the aldonic acids L-lyxonic, L-xylonic, and
L-Threonic acid) with Calcium, and is labelled as Calcium Ascorbate. It is touted to be non-acidic and may be better tolerated by persons with acid reflux, as one study in persons sensitive to acidic foods noted that while 53.6% of the Vitamin C group experienced gastric upset, only 14.3% of the Ester-C group did.[45]

Beyond this, Ester-C appears to be more effective at treating scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)[46] and at decreasing oxalate levels (a metabolite of Vitamin C),[47][48] Ester-C has been reported to reduce the common cold, but was not compared to basic Vitamin C and has not been replicated.[49]

Studies conducted using Ester-C that have been funded by Zila Nutraceuticals are cited following this sentence.[45]


Ester-C is a form of Vitamin C supplementation that may have benefit in persons who are sensitive to acid containing foods, but beyond that its supposed benefits over standard Vitamin C have not been thoroughly proven

Pharmacology

2.1

Serum

Normal circulating concentrations of Vitamin C (as L-ascorbic acid) are in the range of 40-60μM while the reduced form of dehydroascorbate is around 2μM;[20][21] the difference is possibly due to a short half-life of dehydroasorbate of 2-6 minutes.[50] The half-life of ascorbate at a concentration below 70μM is much more prolonged (somewhere between 8 and 40 days) whereas a serum concentration of ascorbate above this threshold (seen with supplementation of over 1,000mg vitamin C) is met with a 30 minute half-life.[51]

Supplemental ascorbate appears to follow a dual phase pharmacokinetic profile. When serum levels are below (within the physiological range) the body tends to regulate ascorbate via resorption in the kidneys (via sodium dependent vitamin C transporters[52]) and have a prolonged half-life of 8-40 days.[53] Serum concentrations

Oral intake of 1,250mg vitamin c is able to increase plasma vitamin C to 134.8+/-20.6μM and is calculated to exceed 220μM when taken at 3,000mg every four hours (in accordance with megadosing therapy for the common cold).[54]

2.2

Distribution

Supplementation of 500mg Vitamin C twice daily appears to increase expression of the transporter that mediates uptake of vitamin C in skeletal muscle (SVCT2) and subsequently Vitamin C concentrations after one week, maintaining over 42 days of supplementation, despite no alterations in oxidative balance.[55]

2.3

Metabolism

Vitamin C appears to be metabolized into primarly one of three metabolites after it turns into a free radical (ascrobyl radical); dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid and oxalic acid which convert into one another in that order. Dietary supplementation does not necessarily increase urinary levels of these metabolites, as there is a lack of metabolism of L-ascorbic acid before it is urinated out.[7][50]

As the first stage of metabolism is turning into a free radical, conditions characterized by excessive oxidation deplete circulating L-ascorbic acid (which acts in a protective but sacrifical manner); this is best shown with studies on smoking[56][57] which usually requires a higher Vitamin C intake.


Vitamin C is metabolized into a free radical (via a sacrifical and protective antioxidant effect) and then converted into dehydroascobic acid. From here, vitamin C then proceeds along to produce oxalic acid via 2,3-diketogulonic acid


3.

Neurology

3.1

Kinetics and Distribution

Vitamin C is actively transported into the brain via the Sodium-dependent Vitamin C Transporter-2 (SVCT2 or Slc23a1) transporter, whereas the oxidized version of Vitamin C (Dehydroascorbic acid) is transported by GLUT transporters.[58][59] Due to this, it is known to be transported across the blood brain barrier.[60][61] While from systemic circulation (through the blood brain barrier) the oxidized form of dehydroascorbate appears to be required to be transported through GLUT transporters,[61] the choroid plexus epithelium (connection of cerebrospinal fluid to the brain) expresses SVCT2[62][63] and this appears to be the majority route of entry.[63][64][65]

There appears to be a 4-fold higher cerebrospinal fluid concentration of ascorbate relative to plasma in rats,[66][65] resulting in a cerebrospinal concentration of around 200-400μM when plasma are 60μM or less[67][68] although human measurements are more modest at 160μM relative to the same plasma level of 40-60μM.[69][70]


Vitamin C can cross the blood brain barrier, but the rate of entry is somewhat limited and and it needs to be in the oxidized form of dehydroascorbate for this to occur. The majority of Vitamin C entry into the brain occurs via cerebrospinal fluid


Within the brain, Vitamin C appears to be in highest concentrations in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and the cerebellum[71][72][73] with slightly lower concentrations in the frontal cortex, thalamic nuclei, olfactoy bulb, and striatum with lowest detected in the spinal cord and pons (lowest).[71][74] It is thought that distribution of Vitamin C in the brain mirrors that of where the SVCT2 transport is expressed (noted to be high in the cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb[75] and frontal cortex[76]), although this does not fully explain the distribution as the parietal cortex does not possess SVCT2.[76]


Vitamin C seems to be in highest concentrations in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal/parietal cortices


3.2

Mechanisms

As mentioned elsewhere (Biological Significance), Vitamin C is a cofactor in the production of catecholamines (via the enzyme dopamine-β-hydroxylase[23][77][78]) and other neurohormones such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.[24][79] Another area that Vitamin C facilitates is supporting HIF-1α production, which uses a prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation similar to what is seen with collagen.[58][80] These enzymatic interactions rely on the ability of L-ascorbic acid to transfer a single electron, and may involve the Vitamin C metabolites as well.


Vitamin C interacts with a variety of enzymes involved in cognition. It does not inherently induce these enzymes (increase their activity or the amount of them), but its existence is required for optimal enzyme functioning; this likely means that for enzymatic benefits perhaps only avoiding a deficiency is required


3.3

Acetylcholine

In isolated rat synaptic vesicles, vitamin C appears to cause acetylcholine release with an EC50 value of 2-2.5µM and appears to be dependent on calcium as it was inhibited with EGTA.[81]

Injections of 60mg/kg vitamin C to mice appears to have acetylcholinesterase inhibiting properties by reducing its activity 17.1% (comparable to 50mg/kg Metrifonate and 150mg/kg oral licorice).[82]

3.4

Neuroprotection

Vitamin C has been found to, in vitro, protect cerebellar granule cells from glutamate induced excitotoxicity[83][84] which is thought to be related to how NDMA receptors can respond to REDOX modulation.[85][86] This is more of a general phenomena that applies to reducing agents (antioxidants), and is abolished by prooxidants.[86]


Vitamin C appears to have putative neuroprotective roles against excitotoxicity (toxicity from excessive cell stimulation) through inhibiting the NMDA receptor. This does not appear to be a unique role for Vitamin C, but something that is attributable to antioxidants in general


3.5

Stress

There appears to be an increase in oxidative stress within cells following percieved stressors (both physical[87] and mental[88][89]), and this increased oxidative state is known to lead to cellular death.

A rat study has noted that oral ingestion of low dose vitamin C (1mg/kg; 0.16mg/kg in humans) was able to suppress an increase in biomarkers of stress in rats, namely oxidation.[90]

3.6

Depression

Vitamin C appears to have antidepressant effects, associated with potassium channels (can be read up on under the depression section on the agmatine page).[91] In short, potassium channel blockers appear to have anti-depressant effects[92] while potassium channel openers have pro-depressive effects and inhibit the actions of potassium channel blockers[93][92] and vitamin C appears to be synergistically antidepressive with potassium channel blockers.[91]


Vitamin C appears to have antidepressant effects. While the direct mechanism of action is not known, it appears to ultimately work via potassium channels (like most antidepressants) and is synergistic with potassium channel blockers


In regards to animal research, administration of Vitamin C has shown an antidepressant effect in a tail suspension test,[94][91] chronic unpredictable manageable stress,[95] and acute stress[90] at a dosage range of 1-10mg/kg oral administration.

In humans, there is an old case study where depression in a child (induced by ACTH administration) was alleviated with vitamin C[96] but more importantly, a study using a product known as Cetebe (3,000mg vitamin C) in otherwise healthy adults for two weeks noted a reduction in depressive symptoms (Becks Depression Inventory) and increase in the frequency of intercourse (no influence on masturbation);[97] this study was funded by the producer of Cetebe, GlaxoSmithKline.


Preliminary evidence in humans to support antidepressant effects in humans, with the lone controlled trial having a notable conflict of interest


3.7

Dementia

Serum concentrations of Vitamin C appear to be inversely related with risk of Dementia, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.29 after controlling for school education, intake of dietary supplements, smoking habits, body mass index, and alcohol consumption.[98]

3.8

Alzheimer's

In regards to Alzheimer's, oxidative stress is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease[99] with byproducts of peroxidation being detected in higher than normal levels in neurofibrillary tangles[100][101][102] and lower serum vitamin C concentrations despite adequate dietary intake[103] although due to a higher cerebrospinal fluid to plasma ratio in alzheimer's (5.1 relative to 3.1 in controls[104]) it is thought the lower serum concentration reflects increased uptake by the brain to counter increaed oxidative stress;[105] this would position the decrease in Vitamin C as a consequence of Alzheimer's rather than a cause.


Vitamin C and oxidative kinetics appear to be altered in persons with Alzheimer's disease


In rat studies, orally ingested Vitamin C (25mg/kg in rats) alongside intracerebral injections of fibrillar amyloid-β was able to reduce oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers (the former comparable to melatonin at 20mg/kg but weaker than vitamin E at 50mg/kg; the latter similar to vitamin E but less than melatonin)[106] although elsewhere in an older APP/PSEN1 transgenic mouse model injected with 125mg/kg vitamin C failed to find evidence for neuroprotection or beneficial changes in oxidation (despite slightly improving memory).[107]


Mixed evidence as to whether vitamin C can be of help. It may be neuroprotective but not rehabilitative, and the benefits appear to extend to other antioxidant compounds as well


4.

Cardiovascular Health

4.1

Blood Flow

There appear to be several disease states or metabolic conditions of which ascorbate deficiency in the endothelium is associated with endothelial dysfunction.[108]

The endothelial variant of the NOS enzyme (eNOS) appears to be susceptible to oxidative damage, including both translation of the enzyme itself[109] and the required cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin is readily oxidized and rendered inactive.[110] Due to this, supplemental antioxidants are thought to preserve the actions of eNOS in instances of excessive oxidative stress and vitamin C has been said to augment nitric oxide production[111] secondary to 'recycling' (preserving) tetrahydrobiopterin.[112][113] As this is an antioxidative effect and other studies in animals have noted comparable benefits with other antioxidants (such as melatonin[114][115]) this is likely just an antioxidative effect rather than a unique property of vitamin C.

Other possible mechanisms that may contribute (also general to antioxidants) include scavenging superoxide[116] which would otherwise reduce nitric oxide into peroxynitrate[117] and directly reducing nitrite (product of nitrate) into nitric oxide[118] or producing nitric oxide from S-nitrosothiols.[119]


Vitamin C appears to promote nitric oxide secondary to its antioxidant properties preventing a unnecessarily rapid decline of nitric oxide. This is not a unique mechanism of action, and is thought to underlie the effects of other potent antioxidants such as melatonin or pycnogenol (both demonstrated to act similarly)


4.2

Atherosclerosis

Vitamin C is known to be required for microsomal 7α-hydroxylation (rate limiting step of the catabolism of cholesterol), and a deficiency of Vitamin C results in excess cholesterol in the liver and increased risk for gallstones.[7][120][121] This increase in cholesterol retention (by reducing its elimination rate) also appears to be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and particularly atherosclerosis.[122][123]

5.

Interactions with Glucose Metabolism

5.1

Pancreas

Ascorbate appears to be important to a pancreatic β-cell due in part to its antioxidant properties[124] (these cells tend to have low levels of antioxidant enzymes[125][126]) and its presence is required for proper secretion of insulin.[127] In rats that are able to synthesize vitamin C, it accumulates to high levels in these cells.[128] Furthermore, there is possible competitive inhibition of ascorbate acid metabolites (dehydroascorbate) with glucose as they use the same transporter.[129]

Two grams of vitamin C daily for 2 weeks in otherwise healthy adults has been noted to delay the postprandial insulin spike and prolong the increase in serum glucose when measured at one hour (but not beyond that),[130] hypothesized to be due to competitive inhibition with glucose into pancreatic β-cells.


Not substantial amounts of evidence at this moment in time, but vitamin C may be protective of pancreatic beta-cells. However, supplementation of vitamin C with glucose may cause a transient state of insulin resistance by increasing circulating glucose and suppressing insulin secretion


5.2

Blood Glucose and Insulin

Many studies have examined the potential role of vitamin C supplementation in reducing glucose levels (fasting and postprandial) and the results have been mixed, with only a few studies finding a statistically significant reduction,[131][132][133] a handful finding a nonsignificant reduction,[134][135][136][137][138] and many not finding a reduction.[139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150] A meta-analysis found that, across all studies, there was no significant effect of vitamin C supplementation on blood glucose levels, however among 15 studies in 597 type 2 diabetics, vitamin C supplementation led to a modest, significant reduction of -0.41 (-0.78, -0.04 95% CI) mmol/L.[151] Studies lasting more than than 30 days yielded greater effects than shorter studies, of which some only gave a single dose on the day of examination. Overall, there didn’t seem to be a great risk of bias, though there wasn't an abundance of particularly well-designed studies with large sample sizes that treated vitamin C as their primary outcome. While there’s a lot of data on the effects of vitamin C, it can’t be said that vitamin C has been properly researched for its effects on blood glucose levels. 

Overall, there was a reduction in fasting insulin, but there was no change in HbA1c, and no subgroup analyses were able to find a stati
